	abstract = {Low-cost short read sequencing technology has revolutionized genomics, though it is only just becoming practical for the high-quality de novo assembly of a novel large genome. We describe the Assemblathon 1 competition, which aimed to comprehensively assess the state of the art in de novo assembly methods when applied to current sequencing technologies. In a collaborative effort, teams were asked to assemble a simulated Illumina {HiSeq} data set of an unknown, simulated diploid genome. A total of 41 assemblies from 17 different groups were received. Novel haplotype aware assessments of coverage, contiguity, structure, base calling, and copy number were made. We establish that within this benchmark: (1) It is possible to assemble the genome to a high level of coverage and accuracy, and that (2) large differences exist between the assemblies, suggesting room for further improvements in current methods. The simulated benchmark, including the correct answer, the assemblies, and the code that was used to evaluate the assemblies is now public and freely available from http://www.assemblathon.org/.},

Assembly and genome binning programs performed well for species represented by individual genomes but were substantially affected by the presence of related strains. Taxonomic profiling and binning programs were proficient at high taxonomic ranks, with a notable performance decrease below family level. Parameter settings markedly affected performance, underscoring their importance for program reproducibility. The {CAMI} results highlight current challenges but also provide a roadmap for software selection to answer specific research questions.},

Notable points include the following: (1) New methods for predicting three dimensional contacts resulted in a few spectacular template free models in this {CASP}, whereas models based on sequence homology to proteins with experimental structure continue to be the most accurate. (2) Refinement of initial protein models, primarily using molecular dynamics related approaches, has now advanced to the point where the best methods can consistently (though slightly) improve nearly all models. (3) The use of relatively sparse {NMR} constraints dramatically improves the accuracy of models, and another type of sparse data, chemical crosslinking, introduced in this {CASP}, also shows promise for producing better models. (4) A new emphasis on modeling protein complexes, in collaboration with {CAPRI}, has produced interesting results, but also shows the need for more focus on this area. (5) Methods for estimating the accuracy of models have advanced to the point where they are of considerable practical use. (6) A first assessment demonstrates that models can sometimes successfully address biological questions that motivate experimental structure determination. (7) There is continuing progress in accuracy of modeling regions of structure not directly available by comparative modeling, while there is marginal or no progress in some other areas.

	abstract = {This article reports the outcome of the 12th round of Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction ({CASP}12), held in 2016. {CASP} is a community experiment to determine the state of the art in modeling protein structure from amino acid sequence. Participants are provided sequence information and in turn provide protein structure models and related information. Analysis of the submitted structures by independent assessors provides a comprehensive picture of the capabilities of current methods, and allows progress to be identified. This was again an exciting round of {CASP}, with significant advances in 4 areas: (i) The use of new methods for predicting three-dimensional contacts led to a two-fold improvement in contact accuracy. (ii) As a consequence, model accuracy for proteins where no template was available improved dramatically. (iii) Models based on a structural template showed overall improvement in accuracy. (iv) Methods for estimating the accuracy of a model continued to improve. {CASP} continued to develop new areas: (i) Assessing methods for building quaternary structure models, including an expansion of the collaboration between {CASP} and {CAPRI}. (ii) Modeling with the aid of experimental data was extended to include {SAXS} data, as well as again using chemical cross-linking information. (iii) A team of assessors evaluated the suitability of models for a range of applications, including mutation interpretation, analysis of ligand binding properties, and identification of interfaces. This article describes the experiment and summarizes the results. The rest of this special issue of {PROTEINS} contains papers describing {CASP}12 results and assessments in more detail.},

Using the phosphoprotein data, we scored more than 2,000 networks submitted by challenge participants. The networks spanned 32 biological contexts and were scored in terms of causal validity with respect to unseen interventional data. A number of approaches were effective, and incorporating known biology was generally advantageous. Additional sub-challenges considered time-course prediction and visualization. Our results suggest that learning causal relationships may be feasible in complex settings such as disease states.

In this crowdsourcing competition, competitors developed algorithms for the prediction of disease progression of 1,822 {ALS} patients from standardized, anonymized phase 2/3 clinical trials. The two best algorithms outperformed a method designed by the challenge organizers as well as predictions by {ALS} clinicians. We estimate that using both winning algorithms in future trial designs could reduce the required number of patients by at least 20\%. The {DREAM}-Phil Bowen {ALS} Prediction Prize4Life challenge also identified several potential nonstandard predictors of disease progression including uric acid, creatinine and surprisingly, blood pressure, shedding light on {ALS} pathobiology.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Finding genes that are differentially expressed between conditions is an integral part of understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. In the past decades, {DNA} microarrays have been used extensively to quantify the abundance of {mRNA} corresponding to different genes, and more recently high-throughput sequencing of {cDNA} ({RNA}-seq) has emerged as a powerful competitor. As the cost of sequencing decreases, it is conceivable that the use of {RNA}-seq for differential expression analysis will increase rapidly. To exploit the possibilities and address the challenges posed by this relatively new type of data, a number of software packages have been developed especially for differential expression analysis of {RNA}-seq data.
{RESULTS}: We conducted an extensive comparison of eleven methods for differential expression analysis of {RNA}-seq data. All methods are freely available within the R framework and take as input a matrix of counts, i.e. the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature of interest in each of a number of samples. We evaluate the methods based on both simulated data and real {RNA}-seq data.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Very small sample sizes, which are still common in {RNA}-seq experiments, impose problems for all evaluated methods and any results obtained under such conditions should be interpreted with caution. For larger sample sizes, the methods combining a variance-stabilizing transformation with the 'limma' method for differential expression analysis perform well under many different conditions, as does the nonparametric {SAMseq} method.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Understanding the regulation of gene expression, including transcription start site usage, alternative splicing, and polyadenylation, requires accurate quantification of expression levels down to the level of individual transcript isoforms. To comparatively evaluate the accuracy of the many methods that have been proposed for estimating transcript isoform abundance from {RNA} sequencing data, we have used both synthetic data as well as an independent experimental method for quantifying the abundance of transcript ends at the genome-wide level.
{RESULTS}: We found that many tools have good accuracy and yield better estimates of gene-level expression compared to commonly used count-based approaches, but they vary widely in memory and runtime requirements. Nucleotide composition and intron/exon structure have comparatively little influence on the accuracy of expression estimates, which correlates most strongly with transcript/gene expression levels. To facilitate the reproduction and further extension of our study, we provide datasets, source code, and an online analysis tool on a companion website, where developers can upload expression estimates obtained with their own tool to compare them to those inferred by the methods assessed here.
{CONCLUSIONS}: As many methods for quantifying isoform abundance with comparable accuracy are available, a user's choice will likely be determined by factors such as the memory and runtime requirements, as well as the availability of methods for downstream analyses. Sequencing-based methods to quantify the abundance of specific transcript regions could complement validation schemes based on synthetic data and quantitative {PCR} in future or ongoing assessments of {RNA}-seq analysis methods.},

Fundamental to the analysis of such {scRNA}-seq data is the ability to cluster similar or same cells into non-overlapping groups. Many competing methods have been proposed for this task, but there is currently little guidance with regards to which method to use. Methods: Here we use one gold standard 10x Genomics dataset, generated from the mixture of three cell lines, as well as multiple silver standard 10x Genomics datasets generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells to examine not only the accuracy but also running time and robustness of a dozen methods. Results: We found that Seurat outperformed other methods, although performance seems to be dependent on many factors, including the complexity of the studied system. Furthermore, we found that solutions produced by different methods have little in common with each other. Conclusions: In light of this we conclude that the choice of clustering tool crucially determines interpretation of {scRNA}-seq data generated by 10x Genomics. Hence practitioners and consumers should remain vigilant about the outcome of 10x Genomics {scRNA}-seq analysis.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In high-throughput studies, hundreds to millions of hypotheses are typically tested. Statistical methods that control the false discovery rate ({FDR}) have emerged as popular and powerful tools for error rate control. While classic {FDR} methods use only p values as input, more modern {FDR} methods have been shown to increase power by incorporating complementary information as informative covariates to prioritize, weight, and group hypotheses. However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigate the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern {FDR}-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biology.
{RESULTS}: Methods that incorporate informative covariates are modestly more powerful than classic approaches, and do not underperform classic approaches, even when the covariate is completely uninformative. The majority of methods are successful at controlling the {FDR}, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we find that the improvement of the modern {FDR} methods over the classic methods increases with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Modern {FDR} methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic {FDR}-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates. We present our findings as a practical guide and provide recommendations to aid researchers in their choice of methods to correct for false discoveries.},

Traditional data analysis by “manual gating” can be inefficient and unreliable in these high-dimensional settings, which has led to the development of a large number of automated analysis methods. Methods designed for unsupervised analysis use specialized clustering algorithms to detect and define cell populations for further downstream analysis. Here, we have performed an up-to-date, extensible performance comparison of clustering methods for high-dimensional flow and mass cytometry data. We evaluated methods using several publicly available data sets from experiments in immunology, containing both major and rare cell populations, with cell population identities from expert manual gating as the reference standard. Several methods performed well, including {FlowSOM}, X-shift, {PhenoGraph}, Rclusterpp, and {flowMeans}. Among these, {FlowSOM} had extremely fast runtimes, making this method well-suited for interactive, exploratory analysis of large, high-dimensional data sets on a standard laptop or desktop computer. These results extend previously published comparisons by focusing on high-dimensional data and including new methods developed for {CyTOF} data. R scripts to reproduce all analyses are available from {GitHub} (https://github.com/lmweber/cytometry-clustering-comparison), and pre-processed data files are available from {FlowRepository} ({FR}-{FCM}-{ZZPH}), allowing our comparisons to be extended to include new clustering methods and reference data sets. © 2016 The Authors.

This has motivated the development and application of a broad range of clustering methods, based on various underlying algorithms. Here, we provide a systematic and extensible performance evaluation of 14 clustering algorithms implemented in R, including both methods developed explicitly for {scRNA}-seq data and more general-purpose methods. The methods were evaluated using nine publicly available {scRNA}-seq data sets as well as three simulations with varying degree of cluster separability. The same feature selection approaches were used for all methods, allowing us to focus on the investigation of the performance of the clustering algorithms themselves. We evaluated the ability of recovering known subpopulations, the stability and the run time and scalability of the methods. Additionally, we investigated whether the performance could be improved by generating consensus partitions from multiple individual clustering methods. We found substantial differences in the performance, run time and stability between the methods, with {SC}3 and Seurat showing the most favorable results. Additionally, we found that consensus clustering typically did not improve the performance compared to the best of the combined methods, but that several of the top-performing methods already perform some type of consensus clustering.

Within such count-based methods, many flexible and advanced statistical approaches now exist and offer the ability to adjust for covariates (e.g. batch effects). Often, these methods include some sort of 'sharing of information' across features to improve inferences in small samples. It is important to achieve an appropriate tradeoff between statistical power and protection against outliers. Here, we study the robustness of existing approaches for count-based differential expression analysis and propose a new strategy based on observation weights that can be used within existing frameworks. The results suggest that outliers can have a global effect on differential analyses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach with real data and simulated data that reflects properties of real datasets (e.g. dispersion-mean trend) and develop an extensible framework for comprehensive testing of current and future methods. In addition, we explore the origin of such outliers, in some cases highlighting additional biological or technical factors within the experiment.

This assumption has proven problematic, and we therefore developed a data-driven approach. Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and leukemic cells. We developed {PhenoGraph}, which algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data. {PhenoGraph} revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was predictive of survival in independent cohorts.

	abstract = {There are many instances in genomics data analyses where measurements are made on a multivariate response. For example, alternative splicing can lead to multiple expressed isoforms from the same primary transcript. There are situations where differences (e.g. between normal and disease state) in the relative ratio of expressed isoforms may have significant phenotypic consequences or lead to prognostic capabilities. Similarly, knowledge of single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) that affect splicing, so-called splicing quantitative trait loci ({sQTL}) will help to characterize the effects of genetic variation on gene expression. {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) has provided an attractive toolbox to carefully unravel alternative splicing outcomes and recently, fast and accurate methods for transcript quantification have become available. We propose a statistical framework based on the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution that can discover changes in isoform usage between conditions and {SNPs} that affect relative expression of transcripts using these quantifications. The Dirichlet-multinomial model naturally accounts for the differential gene expression without losing information about overall gene abundance and by joint modeling of isoform expression, it has the capability to account for their correlated nature. The main challenge in this approach is to get robust estimates of model parameters with limited numbers of replicates. We approach this by sharing information and show that our method improves on existing approaches in terms of standard statistical performance metrics. The framework is applicable to other multivariate scenarios, such as Poly-A-seq or where beta-binomial models have been applied (e.g., differential {DNA} methylation). Our method is available as a Bioconductor R package called {DRIMSeq}.},

	abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of {cDNA} ({RNA}-seq) is a widely deployed transcriptome profiling and annotation technique, but questions about the performance of different protocols and platforms remain. We used a newly developed pool of 96 synthetic {RNAs} with various lengths, and {GC} content covering a 2(20) concentration range as spike-in controls to measure sensitivity, accuracy, and biases in {RNA}-seq experiments as well as to derive standard curves for quantifying the abundance of transcripts. We observed linearity between read density and {RNA} input over the entire detection range and excellent agreement between replicates, but we observed significantly larger imprecision than expected under pure Poisson sampling errors. We use the control {RNAs} to directly measure reproducible protocol-dependent biases due to {GC} content and transcript length as well as stereotypic heterogeneity in coverage across transcripts correlated with position relative to {RNA} termini and priming sequence bias. These effects lead to biased quantification for short transcripts and individual exons, which is a serious problem for measurements of isoform abundances, but that can partially be corrected using appropriate models of bias. By using the control {RNAs}, we derive limits for the discovery and detection of rare transcripts in {RNA}-seq experiments. By using data collected as part of the model organism and human Encyclopedia of {DNA} Elements projects ({ENCODE} and {modENCODE}), we demonstrate that external {RNA} controls are a useful resource for evaluating sensitivity and accuracy of {RNA}-seq experiments for transcriptome discovery and quantification. These quality metrics facilitate comparable analysis across different samples, protocols, and platforms.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The rapid evolution in high-throughput sequencing ({HTS}) technologies has opened up new perspectives in several research fields and led to the production of large volumes of sequence data. A fundamental step in {HTS} data analysis is the mapping of reads onto reference sequences. Choosing a suitable mapper for a given technology and a given application is a subtle task because of the difficulty of evaluating mapping algorithms.
{RESULTS}: In this paper, we present a benchmark procedure to compare mapping algorithms used in {HTS} using both real and simulated datasets and considering four evaluation criteria: computational resource and time requirements, robustness of mapping, ability to report positions for reads in repetitive regions, and ability to retrieve true genetic variation positions. To measure robustness, we introduced a new definition for a correctly mapped read taking into account not only the expected start position of the read but also the end position and the number of indels and substitutions. We developed {CuReSim}, a new read simulator, that is able to generate customized benchmark data for any kind of {HTS} technology by adjusting parameters to the error types. {CuReSim} and {CuReSimEval}, a tool to evaluate the mapping quality of the {CuReSim} simulated reads, are freely available. We applied our benchmark procedure to evaluate 14 mappers in the context of whole genome sequencing of small genomes with Ion Torrent data for which such a comparison has not yet been established.
{CONCLUSIONS}: A benchmark procedure to compare {HTS} data mappers is introduced with a new definition for the mapping correctness as well as tools to generate simulated reads and evaluate mapping quality. The application of this procedure to Ion Torrent data from the whole genome sequencing of small genomes has allowed us to validate our benchmark procedure and demonstrate that it is helpful for selecting a mapper based on the intended application, questions to be addressed, and the technology used. This benchmark procedure can be used to evaluate existing or in-development mappers as well as to optimize parameters of a chosen mapper for any application and any sequencing platform.},

This paper stresses the importance of neutral comparison studies for the objective evaluation of existing methods and the establishment of standards by drawing parallels with clinical research. The goal of the paper is twofold. Firstly, we present a survey of recent computational papers on supervised classification published in seven high-ranking computational science journals. The aim is to provide an up-to-date picture of current scientific practice with respect to the comparison of methods in both articles presenting new methods and articles focusing on the comparison study itself. Secondly, based on the results of our survey we critically discuss the necessity, impact and limitations of neutral comparison studies in computational sciences. We define three reasonable criteria a comparison study has to fulfill in order to be considered as neutral, and explicate general considerations on the individual components of a "tidy neutral comparison study".

	abstract = {Delineating hierarchical cellular states, including rare intermediates and the networks of regulatory genes that orchestrate cell-type specification, are continuing challenges for developmental biology. Single-cell {RNA} sequencing is greatly accelerating such research, given its power to provide comprehensive descriptions of genomic states and their presumptive regulators. Haematopoietic multipotential progenitor cells, as well as bipotential intermediates, manifest mixed-lineage patterns of gene expression at a single-cell level. Such mixed-lineage states may reflect the molecular priming of different developmental potentials by co-expressed alternative-lineage determinants, namely transcription factors. Although a bistable gene regulatory network has been proposed to regulate the specification of either neutrophils or macrophages, the nature of the transition states manifested in vivo, and the underlying dynamics of the cell-fate determinants, have remained elusive. Here we use single-cell {RNA} sequencing coupled with a new analytic tool, iterative clustering and guide-gene selection, and clonogenic assays to delineate hierarchical genomic and regulatory states that culminate in neutrophil or macrophage specification in mice. We show that this analysis captured prevalent mixed-lineage intermediates that manifested concurrent expression of haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor and myeloid progenitor cell genes. It also revealed rare metastable intermediates that had collapsed the haematopoietic stem cell/progenitor gene expression programme, instead expressing low levels of the myeloid determinants, Irf8 and Gfi1 (refs 9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Genetic perturbations and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing revealed Irf8 and Gfi1 as key components of counteracting myeloid-gene-regulatory networks. Combined loss of these two determinants 'trapped' the metastable intermediate. We propose that mixed-lineage states are obligatory during cell-fate specification, manifest differing frequencies because of their dynamic instability and are dictated by counteracting gene-regulatory networks.},

We analyze 3835 Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra and show how our framework yields a more than 95\% reduction in dimensionality.

	abstract = {{SUMMARY} Non-genetic transcriptional variability at the single-cell level is a potential mechanism for therapy resistance in melanoma. Specifically, rare subpopulations of melanoma cells occupy a transient pre-resistant state characterized by coordinated high expression of several genes. Importantly, these rare cells are able to survive drug treatment and develop resistance. How might these extremely rare states arise and disappear within the population? It is unclear whether the canonical stochastic models of probabilistic transcriptional pulsing can explain this behavior, or if it requires special, hitherto unidentified molecular mechanisms. Here we use mathematical modeling to show that a minimal network comprising of transcriptional bursting and interactions between genes can give rise to rare coordinated high states. We next show that although these states occur across networks of different sizes, they depend strongly on three (out of seven) model parameters and require network connectivity to be ≤ 6. Interestingly, we find that while entry into the rare coordinated high state is initiated by a long transcriptional burst that also triggers entry of other genes, the exit from it occurs through the independent inactivation of individual genes. Finally, our model predicts that increased network connectivity can lead to transcriptionally stable states, which we verify using network inference analysis of experimental data. In sum, we demonstrate that established principles of gene regulation are sufficient to describe this new class of rare cell variability and argue for its general existence in other biological contexts.},

We found that expression levels for particular genes are higher than initially reported and can vary substantially among cells. However, variability for most constitutively expressed genes is unexpectedly small. Combining single-transcript measurements with computational modeling indicates that low expression variation is achieved by transcribing genes using single transcription-initiation events that are clearly separated in time, rather than by transcriptional bursts. In contrast, {PDR}5, a gene regulated by the transcription coactivator complex {SAGA}, is expressed using transcription bursts, resulting in larger variation.

Promising new methods have emerged for reconstructing a progression 'trajectory' from static single-cell transcriptome measurements. However, it remains unclear how to adequately model the appreciable level of noise in these data to elucidate gene regulatory network rewiring. Here, we present a framework called Single Cell Inference of {MorphIng} Trajectories and their Associated Regulation ({SCIMITAR}) that infers progressions from static single-cell transcriptomes by employing a continuous parametrization of Gaussian mixtures in high-dimensional curves. {SCIMITAR} yields rich models from the data that highlight genes with expression and co-expression patterns that are associated with the inferred progression. Further, {SCIMITAR} extracts regulatory states from the implicated trajectory-evolvingco-expression networks. We benchmark the method on simulated data to show that it yields accurate cell ordering and gene network inferences. Applied to the interpretation of a single-cell human fetal neuron dataset, {SCIMITAR} finds progression-associated genes in cornerstone neural differentiation pathways missed by standard differential expression tests. Finally, by leveraging the rewiring of gene-gene co-expression relations across the progression, the method reveals the rise and fall of co-regulatory states and trajectory-dependent gene modules. These analyses implicate new transcription factors in neural differentiation including putative co-factors for the multi-functional {NFAT} pathway.},

However, they commonly assume specific geometries such as tree-like developmental hierarchies and lack statistically sound methods to decide on the number of branching events.{ResultsWe} present K-Branches, a solution to the above problem by locally fitting half-lines to single-cell data, introducing a clustering algorithm similar to K-Means. These halflines are proxies for branches in the differentiation trajectory of cells. We propose a modified version of the {GAP} statistic for model selection, in order to decide on the number of lines that best describe the data locally. In this manner, we identify the location and number of subgroups of cells that are associated with branching events and full differentiation, respectively. We evaluate the performance of our method on single-cell {RNA}-Seq data describing the differentiation of myeloid progenitors during hematopoiesis, single-cell {qPCR} data of mouse blastocyst development, single-cell {qPCR} data of human myeloid monocytic leukemia and artificial data.Availability and {implementationAn} R implementation of K-Branches is freely available at https://github.com/theislab/kbranches.Contactfabian.theis@helmholtz-muenchen.{deSupplementary} {informationSupplementary} data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Cell fates are determined by transition-states which occur during complex biological processes such as proliferation and differentiation. The advance in single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNAseq}) provides the snapshots of single cell transcriptomes, thus offering an essential opportunity to study such complex biological processes. Here, we introduce a novel algorithm, {DensityPath}, which visualizes and reconstructs the underlying cell developmental trajectories for large-scale {scRNAseq} data. {DensityPath} has three merits. Firstly, by adopting the nonlinear dimension reduction algorithm elastic embedding, {DensityPath} reveals the intrinsic structures of the data. Secondly, by applying the powerful level set clustering method, {DensityPath} extracts the separate high density clusters of representative cell states ({RCSs}) from the single cell multimodal density landscape of gene expression space, enabling it to handle the heterogeneous {scRNAseq} data elegantly and accurately. Thirdly, {DensityPath} constructs cell state-transition path by finding the geodesic minimum spanning tree of the {RCSs} on the surface of the density landscape, making it more computationally efficient and accurate for large-scale dataset. The cell state-transition path constructed by {DensityPath} has the physical interpretation as the minimum-transition-energy (least-cost) path. We demonstrate that {DensityPath} is capable of identifying complex cell development trajectories with bifurcating and trifurcating branches on the human preimplantation embryos. We demonstrate that {DensityPath} is robust and has high accuracy of pseudotime calculation and branch assignment on the real {scRNAseq} as well as simulated datasets.},

	abstract = {Single-cell genomics has revolutionised modern biology while requiring the development of advanced computational and statistical methods. Advances have been made in uncovering gene expression heterogeneity, discovering new cell types and novel identification of genes and transcription factors involved in cellular processes. One such approach to the analysis is to construct pseudotime orderings of cells as they progress through a particular biological process, such as cell-cycle or differentiation. These methods assign a score - known as the pseudotime - to each cell as a surrogate measure of progression. However, all published methods to date are purely algorithmic and lack any way to give uncertainty to the pseudotime assigned to a cell. Here we present a method that combines Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models ({GP}-{LVM}) with a recently published {electroGP} prior to perform Bayesian inference on the pseudotimes. We go on to show that the posterior variability in these pseudotimes leads to nontrivial uncertainty in the pseudo-temporal ordering of the cells and that pseudotimes should not be thought of as point estimates.},

	abstract = {Author Summary Understanding the “cellular programming” that controls fundamental, dynamic biological processes is important for determining normal cellular function and potential perturbations that might give rise to physiological disorders. Ideally, investigations would employ time series experiments to periodically measure the properties of each cell. This would allow us to understand the sequence of gene (in)activations that constitute the program being followed. In practice, such experiments can be difficult to perform as cellular activity may be asynchronous with each cell occupying a different phase of the process of interested. Furthermore, the unbiased measurement of all transcripts or proteins requires the cells to be captured and lysed precluding the continued monitoring of that cell. In the absence of the ability to conduct true time series experiments, pseudotime algorithms exploit the asynchronous cellular nature of these systems to mathematically assign a “pseudotime” to each cell based on its molecular profile allowing the cells to be aligned and the sequence of gene activation events retrospectively inferred. Existing approaches predominantly use deterministic methods that ignore the statistical uncertainties associated with the problem. This paper demonstrates that this statistical uncertainty limits the temporal resolution that can be extracted from static snapshots of cell expression profiles and can also detrimentally affect downstream analysis.},

	abstract = {The Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model ({GPLVM}) is a popular approach for dimensionality reduction of single-cell data and has been used for pseudotime estimation with capture time information. However current implementations are computationally intensive and will not scale up to modern droplet-based single-cell datasets which routinely profile many tens of thousands of cells. We provide an efficient implementation which allows scaling up this approach to modern single-cell datasets. We also generalize the application of pseudotime inference to cases where there are other sources of variation, such as branching dynamics. We applied our method on microarray, {nCounter}, {RNA}-seq, {qPCR} and droplet-based datasets from different organisms. The model converges an order of magnitude faster compared to existing methods whilst achieving similar levels of estimation accuracy. Further, we demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by extending the model to higher-dimensional latent spaces that can be used to simultaneously infer pseudotime and other structure such as branching. Thus, the model has the capability of producing meaningful biological insights about cell ordering as well as cell fate regulation.

To resolve these issues, we launched the {ICGC}-{TCGA} {DREAM} Somatic Mutation Calling Challenge, a crowdsourced benchmark of somatic mutation detection algorithms. Here we report the {BAMSurgeon} tool for simulating cancer genomes and the results of 248 analyses of three in silico tumors created with it. Different algorithms exhibit characteristic error profiles, and, intriguingly, false positives show a trinucleotide profile very similar to one found in human tumors. Although the three simulated tumors differ in sequence contamination (deviation from normal cell sequence) and in subclonality, an ensemble of pipelines outperforms the best individual pipeline in all cases. {BAMSurgeon} is available at https://github.com/adamewing/bamsurgeon/.},

Studying the properties of genetic networks and how individual genes contribute to overall network functions can provide insight into genetically-mediated disease processes. Most analytical techniques assume a network topology based on normal state networks. However, gene perturbations often lead to the rewiring of relevant networks and impact relationships among other genes. We apply a suite of analysis methodologies to assess the degree of transcriptional network rewiring observed in different sets of melanoma cell lines using whole genome gene expression microarray profiles. We assess evidence for network rewiring in melanoma patient tumor samples using {RNA}-sequence data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We make a distinction between "unsupervised" and "supervised" network-based methods and contrast their use in identifying consistent differences in networks between subsets of cell lines and tumor samples. We find that different genes play more central roles within subsets of genes within a broader network and hence are likely to be better drug targets in a disease state. Ultimately, we argue that our results have important implications for understanding the molecular pathology of melanoma as well as the choice of treatments to combat that pathology.},

We develop a systematic framework called {BEELINE} for this purpose. We use synthetic networks with predictable cellular trajectories as well as curated Boolean models to serve as the ground truth for evaluating the accuracy of {GRN} inference algorithms. We develop a strategy to simulate single-cell gene expression data from these two types of networks that avoids the pitfalls of previously-used methods. We selected 12 representative {GRN} inference algorithms. We found that the accuracy of these methods (measured in terms of {AUROC} and {AUPRC}) was moderate, by and large, although the methods were better in recovering interactions in the synthetic networks than the Boolean models. Techniques that did not require pseudotime-ordered cells were more accurate, in general. The observation that the endpoints of many false positive edges were connected by paths of length two in the Boolean models suggested that indirect effects may be predominant in the outputs of the algorithms we tested. The predicted networks were considerably inconsistent with each other, indicating that combining {GRN} inference algorithms using ensembles is likely to be challenging. Based on the results, we present some recommendations to users of {GRN} inference algorithms, including suggestions on how to create simulated gene expression datasets for testing them. {BEELINE}, which is available at http://github.com/murali-group/{BEELINE} under an open-source license, will aid in the future development of {GRN} inference algorithms for single-cell transcriptomic data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To facilitate this decision-making process, in this tutorial we summarize current methodological and analytical options, and discuss their suitability for a range of research scenarios. Specifically, we provide information about best practices for the separation of individual cells and provide an overview of current single-cell capture methods at different cellular resolutions and scales. Methods for the preparation of {RNA} sequencing libraries vary profoundly across applications, and we discuss features important for an informed selection process. An erroneous or biased analysis can lead to misinterpretations or obscure biologically important information. We provide a guide to the major data processing steps and options for meaningful data interpretation.

Here, we detail the steps of a typical single-cell {RNA}-seq analysis, including pre-processing (quality control, normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell- and gene-level downstream analysis. We formulate current best-practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies.

In this review, we provide an overview of currently available single-cell isolation protocols and {scRNA}-seq technologies, and discuss the methods for diverse {scRNA}-seq data analyses including quality control, read mapping, gene expression quantification, batch effect correction, normalization, imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature selection, cell clustering, trajectory inference, differential expression calling, alternative splicing, allelic expression and gene regulatory network reconstruction. Further, we outline the prospective development and applications of {scRNA}-seq technologies.},

Navigating the vast sea of tools now available is becoming increasingly challenging for researchers. In order to better facilitate selection of appropriate analysis tools we have created the {scRNA}-tools database (www.{scRNA}-tools.org) to catalogue and curate analysis tools as they become available. Our database collects a range of information on each {scRNA}-seq analysis tool and categorises them according to the analysis tasks they perform. Exploration of this database gives insights into the areas of rapid development of analysis methods for {scRNA}-seq data. We see that many tools perform tasks specific to {scRNA}-seq analysis, particularly clustering and ordering of cells. We also find that the {scRNA}-seq community embraces an open-source and open-science approach, with most tools available under open-source licenses and preprints being extensively used as a means to describe methods.

Moreover, 8–19\% of the genes with multiple known transcript isoforms expressed at least two isoforms in the same blastomere or oocyte, which unambiguously demonstrated the complexity of the transcript variants at whole-genome scale in individual cells.

These developments will eventually allow a cell to be represented as a superposition of 'basis vectors', each determining a different (but possibly dependent) aspect of cellular organization and function. However, computational methods must also overcome considerable challenges—from handling technical noise and data scale to forming new abstractions of biology. As the scale of single-cell experiments continues to increase, new computational approaches will be essential for constructing and characterizing a reference map of cell identities.},

Our analyses further delineate molecular cascades underlying {qNSC} activation and neurogenesis initiation, exemplified by decreased extrinsic signaling capacity, primed translational machinery, and regulatory switches in transcription factors, metabolism, and energy sources.

Cells, represented by balls, roll downhill through a landscape of bifurcating valleys.

Here I examine models of two important developmental processes \${\textbackslash}backslash\$textemdash\{\} cell-fate induction and lateral inhibition \${\textbackslash}backslash\$textemdash\{\} and ask whether the landscapes for these models at least qualitatively resemble Waddington's picture. For cell-fate induction, the answer is no. The commitment of a cell to a new fate corresponds to the disappearance of a valley from the landscape, not the splitting of one valley into two, and it occurs through a type of bifurcation \${\textbackslash}backslash\$textemdash\{\} a saddle-node bifurcation \${\textbackslash}backslash\$textemdash\{\} that possesses an intrinsic irreversibility that is missing from Waddington's picture. Lateral inhibition, a symmetrical cell\${\textbackslash}backslash\$textendash\{\}cell competition process, corresponds better to Waddington's picture, with one valley reversibly splitting into two through a pitchfork bifurcation. I propose an alternative epigenetic landscape that has numerous valleys and ridges right from the start, with the process of cell-fate commitment corresponding to the irreversible disappearance of some of these valleys and ridges, via cell-fate induction, complemented by the creation of new valleys and ridges through processes like cell\${\textbackslash}backslash\$textendash\{\}cell competition.},

The overall function of alternative splicing is to increase the diversity of {mRNAs} expressed from the genome. Alternative splicing changes proteins encoded by {mRNAs}, which has profound functional effects. Experimental analysis of these protein isoforms showed that alternative splicing regulates binding between proteins, between proteins and nucleic acids as well as between proteins and membranes. Alternative splicing regulates the localization of proteins, their enzymatic properties and their interaction with ligands. In most cases, changes caused by individual splicing isoforms are small. However, cells typically coordinate numerous changes in ‘splicing programs’, which can have strong effects on cell proliferation, cell survival and properties of the nervous system. Due to its widespread usage and molecular versatility, alternative splicing emerges as a central element in gene regulation that interferes with almost every biological function analyzed.},

	abstract = {The membranes of the first protocells on the early Earth were likely self-assembled from fatty acids. A major challenge in understanding how protocells could have arisen and withstood changes in their environment is that fatty acid membranes are unstable in solutions containing high concentrations of salt (such as would have been prevalent in early oceans) or divalent cations (which would have been required for {RNA} catalysis). To test whether the inclusion of amino acids addresses this problem, we coupled direct techniques of cryoelectron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy with techniques of {NMR} spectroscopy, centrifuge filtration assays, and turbidity measurements. We find that a set of unmodified, prebiotic amino acids binds to prebiotic fatty acid membranes and that a subset stabilizes membranes in the presence of salt and Mg2+. Furthermore, we find that final concentrations of the amino acids need not be high to cause these effects; membrane stabilization persists after dilution as would have occurred during the rehydration of dried or partially dried pools. In addition to providing a means to stabilize protocell membranes, our results address the challenge of explaining how proteins could have become colocalized with membranes. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and our results are consistent with a positive feedback loop in which amino acids bound to self-assembled fatty acid membranes, resulting in membrane stabilization and leading to more binding in turn. High local concentrations of molecular building blocks at the surface of fatty acid membranes may have aided the eventual formation of proteins.},

According to this hypothesis, {RNA} stored both genetic information and catalyzed the chemical reactions in primitive cells. Only later in evolutionary time did {DNA} take over as the genetic material and proteins become the major catalyst and structural component of cells. If this idea is correct, then the transition out of the {RNA} world was never complete; as we have seen in this chapter, {RNA} still catalyzes several fundamental reactions in modern-day cells, which can be viewed as molecular fossils of an earlier world.Figure 6-91Time line for the universe, suggesting the early existence of an {RNA} world of living systems},

Different types of error bars give quite different information, and so figure legends must make clear what error bars represent.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: One of the emerging techniques for performing the analysis of the {DNA} microarray data known as biclustering is the search of subsets of genes and conditions which are coherently expressed. These subgroups provide clues about the main biological processes. Until now, different approaches to this problem have been proposed. Most of them use the mean squared residue as quality measure but relevant and interesting patterns can not be detected such as shifting, or scaling patterns. Furthermore, recent papers show that there exist new coherence patterns involved in different kinds of cancer and tumors such as inverse relationships between genes which can not be captured. {RESULTS}: The proposed measure is called Spearman's biclustering measure ({SBM}) which performs an estimation of the quality of a bicluster based on the non-linear correlation among genes and conditions simultaneously. The search of biclusters is performed by using a evolutionary technique called estimation of distribution algorithms which uses the {SBM} measure as fitness function. This approach has been examined from different points of view by using artificial and real microarrays. The assessment process has involved the use of quality indexes, a set of bicluster patterns of reference including new patterns and a set of statistical tests. It has been also examined the performance using real microarrays and comparing to different algorithmic approaches such as Bimax, {CC}, {OPSM}, Plaid and {xMotifs}. {CONCLUSIONS}: {SBM} shows several advantages such as the ability to recognize more complex coherence patterns such as shifting, scaling and inversion and the capability to selectively marginalize genes and conditions depending on the statistical significance.},

The optimal search methods require large computational time. We report the theoretical analysis and experimental results of the strengths and limitations of the {maxP} technique. Further, using an optimal search method, we combine the strengths of the {maxP} technique and the known {GRN} topology to propose two novel algorithms. These algorithms are implemented in a Bayesian network framework and tested on biological, realistic, and in silico networks of different sizes and topologies.

The {TH}17 transcriptional network consists of two self-reinforcing, but mutually antagonistic, modules, with 12 novel regulators, the coupled action of which may be essential for maintaining the balance between {TH}17 and other {CD}4(+) T-cell subsets.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: With the availability of large scale expression compendia it is now possible to view own findings in the light of what is already available and retrieve genes with an expression profile similar to a set of genes of interest (i.e., a query or seed set) for a subset of conditions. To that end, a query-based strategy is needed that maximally exploits the coexpression behaviour of the seed genes to guide the biclustering, but that at the same time is robust against the presence of noisy genes in the seed set as seed genes are often assumed, but not guaranteed to be coexpressed in the queried compendium. Therefore, we developed {ProBic}, a query-based biclustering strategy based on Probabilistic Relational Models ({PRMs}) that exploits the use of prior distributions to extract the information contained within the seed set. {RESULTS}: We applied {ProBic} on a large scale Escherichia coli compendium to extend partially described regulons with potentially novel members. We compared {ProBic}'s performance with previously published query-based biclustering algorithms, namely {ISA} and {QDB}, from the perspective of bicluster expression quality, robustness of the outcome against noisy seed sets and biological relevance.This comparison learns that {ProBic} is able to retrieve biologically relevant, high quality biclusters that retain their seed genes and that it is particularly strong in handling noisy seeds. {CONCLUSIONS}: {ProBic} is a query-based biclustering algorithm developed in a flexible framework, designed to detect biologically relevant, high quality biclusters that retain relevant seed genes even in the presence of noise or when dealing with low quality seed sets.},

In order to gain insight into the evolution of the E.coli regulatory network, we analysed information obtainable for the domains and protein families of the transcription factors and regulated genes. About three-quarters of the 271 transcription factors we identified are two-domain proteins, consisting of a {DNA}-binding domain along with a regulatory domain. The regulatory domains mainly bind small molecules. Many groups of transcription factors have identical domain architectures, and this implies that roughly three-quarters of the transcription factors have arisen as a consequence of gene duplication. In contrast, there is little evidence of duplication of regulatory regions together with regulated genes or of transcription factors together with regulated genes. Thirty-eight, out of the 121 transcription factors for which one or more regulated genes are known, regulate other transcription factors. This amplification effect, as well as large differences between the numbers of genes directly regulated by transcription factors, means that there are about 10 global regulators which each control many more genes than the other transcription factors.},

The weight assigned to an individual network represents the usefulness of that network in predicting a given gene function. However, because many categories of gene function have a small number of annotations, the process of assigning these network weights is prone to overfitting. {RESULTS}: Here, we address this problem by proposing a novel approach to combining multiple functional association networks. In particular, we present a method where network weights are simultaneously optimized on sets of related function categories. The method is simpler and faster than existing approaches. Further, we show that it produces composite networks with improved function prediction accuracy using five example species (yeast, mouse, fly, Esherichia coli and human). {AVAILABILITY}: Networks and code are available from: http://morrislab.med.utoronto.ca/sara/{SW}},

By interpreting the hematopoietic literature and translating experimental evidence into Boolean rules, we implement binary dynamics on the resulting 11-factor regulatory network. Our network contains interesting functional modules and a concatenation of mutual antagonistic pairs. The state space of our model is a hierarchical, acyclic graph, typifying the principles of myeloid differentiation. We observe excellent agreement between the steady states of our model and microarray expression profiles of two different studies. Moreover, perturbations of the network topology correctly reproduce reported knockout phenotypes in silico.

	volume = {523},
	abstract = {Cell-to-cell variation is a universal feature of life that affects a wide range of biological phenomena, from developmental plasticity to tumour heterogeneity. Although recent advances have improved our ability to document cellular phenotypic variation, the fundamental mechanisms that generate variability from identical {DNA} sequences remain elusive. Here we reveal the landscape and principles of mammalian {DNA} regulatory variation by developing a robust method for mapping the accessible genome of individual cells by assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing ({ATAC}-seq) integrated into a programmable microfluidics platform. Single-cell {ATAC}-seq ({scATAC}-seq) maps from hundreds of single cells in aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles from tens of millions of cells and provide insights into cell-to-cell variation. Accessibility variance is systematically associated with specific trans-factors and cis-elements, and we discover combinations of trans-factors associated with either induction or suppression of cell-to-cell variability. We further identify sets of trans-factors associated with cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types. Targeted perturbations of cell cycle or transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes in this observed variability. The pattern of accessibility variation in cis across the genome recapitulates chromosome compartments de novo, linking single-cell accessibility variation to three-dimensional genome organization. Single-cell analysis of {DNA} accessibility provides new insight into cellular variation of the 'regulome'.},

The complexity of carcinogenic mechanisms leads to heterogeneity in molecular phenotype, pathology, and prognosis of cancers.Genome-wide mutational analysis of cancer genes in individual tumors is the most direct way to elucidate the complex process of disease progression, although such high-throughput sequencing technologies are not yet fully developed. As a surrogate marker for pathway activation analysis, expression profiling using microarrays has been successfully applied for the classification of tumor types, stages of tumor progression, or in some cases, prediction of clinical outcomes. However, the biological implication of those gene expression signatures is often unclear. Systems biological approaches leverage the signature genes as a representation of changes in signaling pathways, instead of interpreting the relevance between each gene and phenotype. This approach, which can be achieved by comparing the gene set or the expression profile with those of reference experiments in which a defined pathway is modulated, will improve our understanding of cancer classification, clinical outcome, and carcinogenesis. In this review, we will discuss recent studies on the development of expression signatures to monitor signaling pathway activities and how these signatures can be used to improve the identification of responders to anticancer drugs.},

However, differentially expressed genes are only a proxy for finding dysregulated pathways. The problem is to identify how the network of regulatory and physical interactions rewires in different conditions or in disease. {RESULTS}: We developed a procedure named {DINA} ({DIfferential} Network Analysis), which is able to identify set of genes, whose co-regulation is condition-specific, starting from a collection of condition-specific gene expression profiles. {DINA} is also able to predict which transcription factors ({TFs}) may be responsible for the pathway condition-specific co-regulation. We derived 30 tissue-specific gene networks in human and identified several metabolic pathways as the most differentially regulated across the tissues. We correctly identified {TFs} such as Nuclear Receptors as their main regulators and demonstrated that a gene with unknown function ({YEATS}2) acts as a negative regulator of hepatocyte metabolism. Finally, we showed that {DINA} can be used to make hypotheses on dysregulated pathways during disease progression. By analyzing gene expression profiles across primary and transformed hepatocytes, {DINA} identified hepatocarcinoma-specific metabolic and transcriptional pathway dysregulation. {AVAILABILITY}: We implemented an on-line web-tool http://dina.tigem.it enabling the user to apply {DINA} to identify tissue-specific pathways or gene signatures. {CONTACT}: dibernardo@tigem.it {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We utilized two gene expression technologies to profile 48 genes in single cells at various stages during the reprogramming process. Analysis of early stages revealed considerable variation in gene expression between cells in contrast to late stages. Expression of Esrrb, Utf1, Lin28, and Dppa2 is a better predictor for cells to progress into {iPSCs} than expression of the previously suggested reprogramming markers Fbxo15, Fgf4, and Oct4. Stochastic gene expression early in reprogramming is followed by a late hierarchical phase with Sox2 being the upstream factor in a gene expression hierarchy. Finally, downstream factors derived from the late phase, which do not include Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, and Nanog, can activate the pluripotency circuitry.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: To improve the understanding of molecular regulation events, various approaches have been developed for deducing gene regulatory networks from {mRNA} expression data. {RESULTS}: We present a new score for network inference, η(2), that is derived from an analysis of variance. Candidate transcription factor:target gene ({TF}:{TG}) relationships are assumed more likely if the expression of {TF} and {TG} are mutually dependent in at least a subset of the examined experiments. We evaluate this dependency by η(2), a non-parametric, non-linear correlation coefficient. It is fast, easy to apply and does not require the discretization of the input data. In the recent {DREAM}5 blind assessment, the arguably most comprehensive evaluation of inference methods, our approach based on η(2) was rated the best performer on real expression compendia. It also performs better than methods tested in other recently published comparative assessments. About half of our predicted novel predictions are true interactions as estimated from {qPCR} experiments performed for {DREAM}5. Conclusions: The score η(2) has a number of interesting features that enable the efficient detection of gene regulatory interactions. For most experimental setups, it is an interesting alternative to other measures of dependency such as Pearson's correlation or mutual information.},

Scientific journals require data and code sharing, but none currently require authors to guarantee software usability and long-term archival stability of newly published tools. We developed an accurate estimation of the accessibility of computational biology software tools by performing an empirical analysis of usability and archival stability of 24,490 omics software resources published from 2000 to 2017. We found that 26\% of all omics software resources are currently not accessible through {URLs} published in the paper. Among the tools selected for our comprehensive and systematic usability test, 49\% were deemed "difficult to install," and 28\% of the tools failed to be installed due to problems in the implementation. Moreover, for papers introducing new software, we found that the number of citations significantly increased when authors provided an easy installation process for published software. We propose for incorporation into journal policy several practical solutions for increasing the widespread usability and archival stability of published bioinformatics software.},

We demonstrated higher expressions of human {BDNF} {mRNA} in neuroblastomas with unfavorable biologies and with N-myc amplification than in those with favorable biologies. For the first time we revealed the composition of splice variants of human {BDNF} {mRNA} and analyzed their expression in neuroblastomas by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ({RT}-{PCR}). Interestingly, human {BDNF} {mRNA} consisted of at least six isoforms, four isoforms resembling those of rat {BDNF} {mRNA}, a human-specific isoform and a new isoform. The expression of four isoforms were more prominent in tumors with unfavorable biologies than in those with favorable biologies (P{\textbackslash}textless0.05). As previously we had reported, over 80\% of the primary tumors expressed either the full-length form of {BDNF} receptor, {TRKB}, or a truncated form of {TRKB} lacking the tyrosine kinase domain. The full-length {TRKB} was predominantly detected in tumors with unfavorable biologies, and the truncated one in those with favorable biologies. These results suggest that an autocrine and/or paracrine mechanism involving {BDNF} may stimulate signal transduction via {TRKB} receptors rich in neuroblastomas with unfavorable biologies, resulting in an aberrant survival of tumor cells.},

	volume = {165},
	abstract = {The major and essential objective of pre-implantation development is to establish embryonic and extra-embryonic cell fates. To address when and how this fundamental process is initiated in mammals, we characterize transcriptomes of all individual cells throughout mouse pre-implantation development. This identifies targets of master pluripotency regulators Oct4 and Sox2 as being highly heterogeneously expressed between blastomeres of the 4-cell embryo, with Sox21 showing one of the most heterogeneous expression profiles. Live-cell tracking demonstrates that cells with decreased Sox21 yield more extra-embryonic than pluripotent progeny. Consistently, decreasing Sox21 results in premature upregulation of the differentiation regulator Cdx2, suggesting that Sox21 helps safeguard pluripotency. Furthermore, Sox21 is elevated following increased expression of the histone H3R26-methylase {CARM}1 and is lowered following {CARM}1 inhibition, indicating the importance of epigenetic regulation. Therefore, our results indicate that heterogeneous gene expression, as early as the 4-cell stage, initiates cell-fate decisions by modulating the balance of pluripotency and differentiation.},

	abstract = {Neuroblastoma is an embryonic tumor arising from immature sympathetic nervous system cells. Recurrent genomic alterations include {MYCN} and {ALK} amplification as well as recurrent patterns of gains and losses of whole or large partial chromosome segments. A recent whole genome sequencing effort yielded no frequently recurring mutations in genes other than those affecting {ALK}. However, the study further stresses the importance of {DNA} copy number alterations in this disease, in particular for genes implicated in neuritogenesis. Here we provide additional evidence for the importance of focal {DNA} copy number gains and losses, which are predominantly observed in {MYCN} amplified tumors. A focal 5 kb gain encompassing the {MYCN} regulated {miR}-17∼92 cluster as sole gene was detected in a neuroblastoma cell line and further analyses of the array {CGH} data set demonstrated enrichment for other {MYCN} target genes in focal gains and amplifications. Next we applied an integrated genomics analysis to prioritize {MYCN} down regulated genes mediated by {MYCN} driven {miRNAs} within regions of focal heterozygous or homozygous deletion. We identified {RGS}5, a negative regulator of G-protein signaling implicated in vascular normalization, invasion and metastasis, targeted by a focal homozygous deletion, as a new {MYCN} target gene, down regulated through {MYCN} activated {miRNAs}. In addition, we expand the {miR}-17∼92 regulatory network controlling {TGF}{\textbackslash}s s signaling in neuroblastoma with the ring finger protein 11 encoding gene {RNF}11, which was previously shown to be targeted by the {miR}-17∼92 member {miR}-19b. Taken together, our data indicate that focal {DNA} copy number imbalances in neuroblastoma (1) target genes that are implicated in {MYCN} signaling, possibly selected to reinforce {MYCN} oncogene addiction and (2) serve as a resource for identifying new molecular targets for treatment.},

The comprehensive analysis of molecular association patterns and their changes in relation to different physiological conditions can yield insight into the biological basis of disease-specific phenotype variation. {METHODOLOGY}: Here, we introduce a formal statistical method for the differential analysis of molecular associations via network representation. We illustrate our approach with extensive data on lipoprotein subclasses measured by {NMR} spectroscopy in 4,406 individuals with normal fasting glucose, and 531 subjects with impaired fasting glucose (prediabetes). We estimate the pair-wise association between measures using shrinkage estimates of partial correlations and build the differential network based on this measure of association. We explore the topological properties of the inferred network to gain insight into important metabolic differences between individuals with normal fasting glucose and prediabetes. {CONCLUSIONS}/{SIGNIFICANCE}: Differential networks provide new insights characterizing differences in biological states. Based on conventional statistical methods, few differences in concentration levels of lipoprotein subclasses were found between individuals with normal fasting glucose and individuals with prediabetes. By performing the differential analysis of networks, several characteristic changes in lipoprotein metabolism known to be related to diabetic dyslipidemias were identified. The results demonstrate the applicability of the new approach to identify key molecular changes inaccessible to standard approaches.},

	doi = {10.1101/060442},
	abstract = {Pseudotime estimation from single-cell gene expression allows the recovery of temporal information from otherwise static profiles of individual cells. This pseudotemporal information can be used to characterise transient events in temporally evolving biological systems. Conventional algorithms typically emphasise an unsupervised transcriptome-wide approach and use retrospective analysis to evaluate the behaviour of individual genes. Here we introduce an orthogonal approach termed "Ouija" that learns pseudotimes from a small set of marker genes that might ordinarily be used to retrospectively confirm the accuracy of unsupervised pseudotime algorithms. Crucially, we model these genes in terms of switch-like or transient behaviour along the trajectory, allowing us to understand why the pseudotimes have been inferred and learn informative parameters about the behaviour of each gene. Since each gene is associated with a switch or peak time the genes are effectively ordered along with the cells, allowing each part of the trajectory to be understood in terms of the behaviour of certain genes. In the following we introduce our model and demonstrate that in many instances a small panel of marker genes can recover pseudotimes that are consistent with those obtained using the entire transcriptome. Furthermore, we show that our method can detect differences in the regulation timings between two genes and identify "metastable" states - discrete cell types along the continuous trajectories - that recapitulate known cell types. Ouija therefore provides a powerful complimentary approach to existing whole transcriptome based pseudotime estimation methods. An open source implementation is available at http://www.github.com/kieranrcampbell/ouija as an R package and at http://www.github.com/kieranrcampbell/ouijaflow as a Python/{TensorFlow} package.},

We hypothesized that activated Wnt/beta-catenin ({CTNNB}1) signaling might account for this as {MYC} is a beta-catenin transcriptional target and multiple embryonal and neural crest malignancies have oncogenic alterations in this pathway. {NB} cell lines without {MYCN} amplification express higher levels of {MYC} and beta-catenin (with aberrant nuclear localization) than {MYCN}-amplified cell lines. Evidence for aberrant beta-catenin-{TCF} transcriptional activity was demonstrated using expression profiles from 73 primary {NBs}. Findings included increased {WNT} ligands ({WNT}1, {WNT}6, {WNT}7A, {WNT}10B), {DVL}1 and {TCF}7 expression in high-risk {NBs} without {MYCN} amplification, consistent with canonical beta-catenin signaling. More directly, Patterns of Gene Expression and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses demonstrated beta-catenin target genes (for example, {MYC}, {PPARD}, {NRCAM}, {CD}44, {TCF}7) as coordinately upregulated in high-risk {NBs} without {MYCN} amplification in comparison to high-risk {MYCN}-amplified or intermediate-risk {NBs}, supporting pathway activation in this subset. Thus, high-risk {NBs} without {MYCN} amplification may deregulate {MYC} and other oncogenic genes via altered beta-catenin signaling providing a potential candidate pathway for therapeutic inhibition.},

A major challenge in computational biology is to uncover, from such measurements, gene/protein interactions and key biological features of cellular systems. In this paper, we propose a new framework for discovering interactions between genes based on multiple expression measurements. This framework builds on the use of Bayesian networks for representing statistical dependencies. A Bayesian network is a graph-based model of joint multivariate probability distributions that captures properties of conditional independence between variables. Such models are attractive for their ability to describe complex stochastic processes and because they provide a clear methodology for learning from (noisy) observations. We start by showing how Bayesian networks can describe interactions between genes. We then describe a method for recovering gene interactions from microarray data using tools for learning Bayesian networks. Finally, we demonstrate this method on the S. cerevisiae cell-cycle measurements of Spellman et al. (1998).},

Here we show that mouse {TF} footprints conjointly encode a regulatory lexicon that is ∼95\% similar with that derived from human {TF} footprints. However, only ∼20\% of mouse {TF} footprints have human orthologues. Despite substantial turnover of the cis-regulatory landscape, nearly half of all pairwise regulatory interactions connecting mouse {TF} genes have been maintained in orthologous human cell types through evolutionary innovation of {TF} recognition sequences. Furthermore, the higher-level organization of mouse {TF}-to-{TF} connections into cellular network architectures is nearly identical with human.

	doi = {10.1101/208819},
	abstract = {Single-cell {RNA}-seq allows quantification of biological heterogeneity across both discrete cell types and continuous cell differentiation transitions. We present approximate graph abstraction ({AGA}), an algorithm that reconciles the computational analysis strategies of clustering and trajectory inference by explaining cell-to-cell variation both in terms of discrete and continuous latent variables (https://github.com/theislab/graph\_abstraction). This enables to generate cellular maps of differentiation manifolds with complex topologies — efficiently and robustly across different datasets. Approximate graph abstraction quantifies the connectivity of partitions of a neighborhood graph of single cells, thereby generating a much simpler abstracted graph whose nodes label the partitions. Together with a random walk-based distance measure, this generates a topology preserving map of single cells — a partial coordinatization of data useful for exploring and explaining its variation. We use the abstracted graph to assess which subsets of data are better explained by discrete clusters than by a continuous variable, to trace gene expression changes along aggregated single-cell paths through data and to infer abstracted trees that best explain the global topology of data. We demonstrate the power of the method by reconstructing differentiation processes with high numbers of branchings from single-cell gene expression datasets and by identifying biological trajectories from single-cell imaging data using a deep-learning based distance metric. Along with the method, we introduce measures for the connectivity of graph partitions, generalize random-walk based distance measures to disconnected graphs and introduce a path-based measure for topological similarity between graphs.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Only a few small studies have assessed the long-term morbidity that follows the treatment of childhood cancer. We determined the incidence and severity of chronic health conditions in adult survivors. {METHODS}: The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a retrospective cohort study that tracks the health status of adults who received a diagnosis of childhood cancer between 1970 and 1986 and compares the results with those of siblings. We calculated the frequencies of chronic conditions in 10,397 survivors and 3034 siblings. A severity score (grades 1 through 4, ranging from mild to life-threatening or disabling) was assigned to each condition. Cox proportional-hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios, reported as relative risks and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs}), for a chronic condition. {RESULTS}: Survivors and siblings had mean ages of 26.6 years (range, 18.0 to 48.0) and 29.2 years (range, 18.0 to 56.0), respectively, at the time of the study. Among 10,397 survivors, 62.3\% had at least one chronic condition; 27.5\% had a severe or life-threatening condition (grade 3 or 4). The adjusted relative risk of a chronic condition in a survivor, as compared with siblings, was 3.3 (95\% {CI}, 3.0 to 3.5); for a severe or life-threatening condition, the risk was 8.2 (95\% {CI}, 6.9 to 9.7). Among survivors, the cumulative incidence of a chronic health condition reached 73.4\% (95\% {CI}, 69.0 to 77.9) 30 years after the cancer diagnosis, with a cumulative incidence of 42.4\% (95\% {CI}, 33.7 to 51.2) for severe, disabling, or life-threatening conditions or death due to a chronic condition. {CONCLUSIONS}: Survivors of childhood cancer have a high rate of illness owing to chronic health conditions.},

	abstract = {Receiver Operator Characteristic ({ROC}) curves are commonly used to present results for binary decision problems in machine learning. However, when dealing with highly skewed datasets, Precision-Recall ({PR}) curves give a more informative picture of an algorithm's performance. We show that a deep connection exists between {ROC} space and {PR} space, such that a curve dominates in {ROC} space if and only if it dominates in {PR} space. A corollary is the notion of an achievable {PR} curve, which has properties much like the convex hull in {ROC} space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in {PR} space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that optimize the area under the {ROC} curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the {PR} curve.},

Similarity network fusion ({SNF}) solves this problem by constructing networks of samples (e.g., patients) for each available data type and then efficiently fusing these into one network that represents the full spectrum of underlying data. For example, to create a comprehensive view of a disease given a cohort of patients, {SNF} computes and fuses patient similarity networks obtained from each of their data types separately, taking advantage of the complementarity in the data. We used {SNF} to combine {mRNA} expression, {DNA} methylation and {microRNA} ({miRNA}) expression data for five cancer data sets. {SNF} substantially outperforms single data type analysis and established integrative approaches when identifying cancer subtypes and is effective for predicting survival.},

We find that human {TF} networks are highly cell selective and are driven by cohorts of factors that include regulators with previously unrecognized roles in control of cellular identity. Moreover, we identify many widely expressed factors that impact transcriptional regulatory networks in a cell-selective manner. Strikingly, in spite of their inherent diversity, all cell-type regulatory networks independently converge on a common architecture that closely resembles the topology of living neuronal networks. Together, our results provide an extensive description of the circuitry, dynamics, and organizing principles of the human {TF} regulatory network. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-9-70},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The recent explosion in biological and other real-world network data has created the need for improved tools for large network analyses. In addition to well established global network properties, several new mathematical techniques for analyzing local structural properties of large networks have been developed. Small over-represented subgraphs, called network motifs, have been introduced to identify simple building blocks of complex networks. Small induced subgraphs, called graphlets, have been used to develop "network signatures" that summarize network topologies. Based on these network signatures, two new highly sensitive measures of network local structural similarities were designed: the relative graphlet frequency distance ({RGF}-distance) and the graphlet degree distribution agreement ({GDD}-agreement). Finding adequate null-models for biological networks is important in many research domains. Network properties are used to assess the fit of network models to the data. Various network models have been proposed. To date, there does not exist a software tool that measures the above mentioned local network properties. Moreover, none of the existing tools compare real-world networks against a series of network models with respect to these local as well as a multitude of global network properties. {RESULTS}: Thus, we introduce {GraphCrunch}, a software tool that finds well-fitting network models by comparing large real-world networks against random graph models according to various network structural similarity measures. It has unique capabilities of finding computationally expensive {RGF}-distance and {GDD}-agreement measures. In addition, it computes several standard global network measures and thus supports the largest variety of network measures thus far. Also, it is the first software tool that compares real-world networks against a series of network models and that has built-in parallel computing capabilities allowing for a user specified list of machines on which to perform compute intensive searches for local network properties. Furthermore, {GraphCrunch} is easily extendible to include additional network measures and models. {CONCLUSION}: {GraphCrunch} is a software tool that implements the latest research on biological network models and properties: it compares real-world networks against a series of random graph models with respect to a multitude of local and global network properties. We present {GraphCrunch} as a comprehensive, parallelizable, and easily extendible software tool for analyzing and modeling large biological networks. The software is open-source and freely available at http://www.ics.uci.edu/∼bio-nets/graphcrunch/. It runs under Linux, {MacOS}, and Windows Cygwin. In addition, it has an easy to use on-line web user interface that is available from the above web page.},

So far, however, a systematic critical study concerning the various sources underlying this over-optimism is lacking.Results: We present an empirical study on over-optimism using high-dimensional classification as example. Specifically, we consider a `promising' new classification algorithm, namely linear discriminant analysis incorporating prior knowledge on gene functional groups through an appropriate shrinkage of the within-group covariance matrix. While this approach yields poor results in terms of error rate, we quantitatively demonstrate that it can artificially seem superior to existing approaches if we `fish for significance'. The investigated sources of over-optimism include the optimization of datasets, of settings, of competing methods and, most importantly, of the method's characteristics. We conclude that, if the improvement of a quantitative criterion such as the error rate is the main contribution of a paper, the superiority of new algorithms should always be demonstrated on independent validation data.Availability: The R codes and relevant data can be downloaded from http://www.ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/mitarbeiter/020\_professuren/boulesteix/overoptimism/, such that the study is completely reproducible.Contact:boulesteix@ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Elucidating gene regulatory networks is crucial for understanding normal cell physiology and complex pathologic phenotypes. Existing computational methods for the genome-wide "reverse engineering" of such networks have been successful only for lower eukaryotes with simple genomes. Here we present {ARACNE}, a novel algorithm, using microarray expression profiles, specifically designed to scale up to the complexity of regulatory networks in mammalian cells, yet general enough to address a wider range of network deconvolution problems. This method uses an information theoretic approach to eliminate the majority of indirect interactions inferred by co-expression methods. {RESULTS}: We prove that {ARACNE} reconstructs the network exactly (asymptotically) if the effect of loops in the network topology is negligible, and we show that the algorithm works well in practice, even in the presence of numerous loops and complex topologies. We assess {ARACNE}'s ability to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks using both a realistic synthetic dataset and a microarray dataset from human B cells. On synthetic datasets {ARACNE} achieves very low error rates and outperforms established methods, such as Relevance Networks and Bayesian Networks. Application to the deconvolution of genetic networks in human B cells demonstrates {ARACNE}'s ability to infer validated transcriptional targets of the {cMYC} proto-oncogene. We also study the effects of misestimation of mutual information on network reconstruction, and show that algorithms based on mutual information ranking are more resilient to estimation errors. {CONCLUSION}: {ARACNE} shows promise in identifying direct transcriptional interactions in mammalian cellular networks, a problem that has challenged existing reverse engineering algorithms. This approach should enhance our ability to use microarray data to elucidate functional mechanisms that underlie cellular processes and to identify molecular targets of pharmacological compounds in mammalian cellular networks.},

A complete picture of gene-gene associations/interactions would open new horizons for biologists, ranging from pure appreciation to successful manipulation of biological pathways for therapeutic purposes. Therefore, identification of important biological complexes whose members (genes and their products proteins) interact with each other is of prime importance. Numerous experimental methods exist but, for the most part, they are costly and labor intensive. Computational techniques, such as the one proposed in this work, provide a quick 'budget' solution that can be used as a screening tool before more expensive techniques are attempted. Here, we introduce a novel computational method based on the partial least squares ({PLS}) regression technique for reconstruction of genetic networks from microarray data. {RESULTS}: The proposed {PLS} method is shown to be an effective screening procedure for the detection of gene-gene interactions from microarray data.

It is attained by several underlying principles that are universal to both biological organisms and sophisticated engineering systems. Robustness facilitates evolvability and robust traits are often selected by evolution. Such a mutually beneficial process is made possible by specific architectural features observed in robust systems. But there are trade-offs between robustness, fragility, performance and resource demands, which explain system behaviour, including the patterns of failure. Insights into inherent properties of robust systems will provide us with a better understanding of complex diseases and a guiding principle for therapy design.},

Although recently new insights into genes involved in {NB} have emerged, the molecular basis of neuroblastoma development and progression still remains poorly understood. The best-characterized genetic alterations include amplification of the proto-oncogene {MYCN}, {ALK} activating mutations or amplification, gain of chromosome arm 17q and losses of 1p, 3p, and 11q. Epigenetic alterations have been described as well: caspase-8 ({CASP}8) and {RAS}-association domain family 1 isoform A ({RASSF}1A) {DNA}-methylation are important events for the development and progression of neuroblastoma. In total, there are about 75 genes described as epigenetically affected in {NB} cell lines and/or {NB} primary samples. These epigenetic alterations were either found using a candidate gene approach or based on the analysis of genome-wide screening techniques. This review gives an extensive overview of all epigenetic changes described in {NB} as of today, with a main focus on both prognostic use and the potential of genome-wide techniques to find epigenetic prognostic biomarkers in {NB}. We summarize the key findings so far and the state-of-the-art of the upcoming methods at a unique time frame in the transition towards combined genome wide chromatin immune-precipitation ({ChIP}) and {DNA} sequencing techniques.},

Graphlet-based methods are proving to be useful in this respect. Recently some doubt has arisen concerning the applicability of graphlet-based measures to low edge density networks-in particular that the methods are 'unstable'-and further that no existing network model matches the structure found in real biological networks. {RESULTS}: We demonstrate that it is the model networks themselves that are 'unstable' at low edge density and that graphlet-based measures correctly reflect this instability. Furthermore, while model network topology is unstable at low edge density, biological network topology is stable. In particular, one must distinguish between average density and local density. While model networks of low average edge densities also have low local edge density, that is not the case with protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) networks: real {PPI} networks have low average edge density, but high local edge densities, and hence, they (and thus graphlet-based measures) are stable on these networks. Finally, we use a recently devised non-parametric statistical test to demonstrate that {PPI} networks of many species are well-fit by several models not previously tested. In addition, we model several viral {PPI} networks for the first time and demonstrate an exceptionally good fit between the data and theoretical models.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Recent advancements in experimental biotechnology have produced large amounts of protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) data. The topology of {PPI} networks is believed to have a strong link to their function. Hence, the abundance of {PPI} data for many organisms stimulates the development of computational techniques for the modeling, comparison, alignment, and clustering of networks. In addition, finding representative models for {PPI} networks will improve our understanding of the cell just as a model of gravity has helped us understand planetary motion. To decide if a model is representative, we need quantitative comparisons of model networks to real ones. However, exact network comparison is computationally intractable and therefore several heuristics have been used instead. Some of these heuristics are easily computable "network properties," such as the degree distribution, or the clustering coefficient. An important special case of network comparison is the network alignment problem. Analogous to sequence alignment, this problem asks to find the "best" mapping between regions in two networks. It is expected that network alignment might have as strong an impact on our understanding of biology as sequence alignment has had. Topology-based clustering of nodes in {PPI} networks is another example of an important network analysis problem that can uncover relationships between interaction patterns and phenotype. {RESULTS}: We introduce the {GraphCrunch} 2 software tool, which addresses these problems. It is a significant extension of {GraphCrunch} which implements the most popular random network models and compares them with the data networks with respect to many network properties. Also, {GraphCrunch} 2 implements the {GRAph} {ALigner} algorithm ("{GRAAL}") for purely topological network alignment. {GRAAL} can align any pair of networks and exposes large, dense, contiguous regions of topological and functional similarities far larger than any other existing tool. Finally, {GraphCruch} 2 implements an algorithm for clustering nodes within a network based solely on their topological similarities. Using {GraphCrunch} 2, we demonstrate that eukaryotic and viral {PPI} networks may belong to different graph model families and show that topology-based clustering can reveal important functional similarities between proteins within yeast and human {PPI} networks. {CONCLUSIONS}: {GraphCrunch} 2 is a software tool that implements the latest research on biological network analysis. It parallelizes computationally intensive tasks to fully utilize the potential of modern multi-core {CPUs}. It is open-source and freely available for research use. It runs under the Windows and Linux platforms.},

	abstract = {Single-cell expression profiling reveals the molecular states of individual cells with unprecedented detail. Because these methods destroy cells in the process of analysis, they cannot measure how gene expression changes over time. However, some information on dynamics is present in the data: the continuum of molecular states in the population can reflect the trajectory of a typical cell. Many methods for extracting single-cell dynamics from population data have been proposed. However, all such attempts face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cell states, there are multiple dynamics that could give rise to it, and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we describe the aspects of gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static snapshot alone and identify assumptions necessary to constrain a unique solution for cell dynamics from static snapshots. We translate these constraints into a practical algorithmic approach, population balance analysis ({PBA}), which makes use of a method from spectral graph theory to solve a class of high-dimensional differential equations. We use simulations to show the strengths and limitations of {PBA}, and then apply it to single-cell profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells ({HPCs}). Cell state predictions from this analysis agree with {HPC} fate assays reported in several papers over the past two decades. By highlighting the fundamental limits on dynamic inference faced by any method, our framework provides a rigorous basis for dynamic interpretation of a gene expression continuum and clarifies best experimental designs for trajectory reconstruction from static snapshot measurements.},

These migratory events determine the efficiency of the adaptive immune response. Their regulation by the core cell locomotion machinery has not been determined. Here, we show that the migration of immature {DCs} depends on two main actin pools: a {RhoA}-{mDia}1-dependent actin pool located at their rear, which facilitates forward locomotion; and a Cdc42-Arp2/3-dependent actin pool present at their front, which limits migration but promotes antigen capture. Following {TLR}4-{MyD}88-induced maturation, Arp2/3-dependent actin enrichment at the cell front is markedly reduced. Consequently, mature {DCs} switch to a faster and more persistent {mDia}1-dependent locomotion mode that facilitates chemotactic migration to {LVs} and lymph nodes. Thus, the differential use of actin-nucleating machineries optimizes the migration of immature and mature {DCs} according to their specific function.},

We show that signalling entropy provides a more accurate and robust potency estimate than other entropy-based measures, driven in part by a subtle positive correlation between the transcriptome and connectome. Signalling entropy identifies known cell subpopulations of varying potency and drug resistant cancer stem-cell phenotypes, including those derived from circulating tumour cells. It further reveals that expression heterogeneity within single-cell populations is regulated. In summary, signalling entropy allows in silico estimation of the differentiation potency and plasticity of single cells and bulk samples, providing a means to identify normal and cancer stem-cell phenotypes.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Protein structure alignment is key for transferring information from well-studied proteins to less studied ones. Structural alignment identifies the most precise mapping of equivalent residues, as structures are more conserved during evolution than sequences. Among the methods for aligning protein structures, maximum Contact Map Overlap ({CMO}) has received sustained attention during the past decade. Yet, known algorithms exhibit modest performance and are not applicable for large-scale comparison. {RESULTS}: Graphlets are small induced subgraphs that are used to design sensitive topological similarity measures between nodes and networks. By generalizing graphlets to ordered graphs, we introduce {GR}-Align, a {CMO} heuristic that is suited for database searches. On the Proteus\_300 set (44 850 protein domain pairs), {GR}-Align is several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art {CMO} solvers Apurva, {MSVNS} and {AlEigen}7, and its similarity score is in better agreement with the structural classification of proteins. On a large-scale experiment on the Gold-standard benchmark dataset (3 207 270 protein domain pairs), {GR}-Align is several orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art protein structure comparison tools {TM}-Align, {DaliLite}, {MATT} and Yakusa, while achieving similar classification performances. Finally, we illustrate the difference between {GR}-Align's flexible alignments and the traditional ones by querying a flexible protein in the Astral-40 database (11 154 protein domains). In this experiment, {GR}-Align's top scoring alignments are not only in better agreement with structural classification of proteins, but also that they allow transferring more information across proteins.},

The underlying regulatory logic among network components was then learned using the initial network topology and single cell gene expression measurements from {mESCs} cultured in serum/{LIF} or serum-free 2i/{LIF} conditions. Comparing the learned network regulatory logic derived from cells cultured in serum/{LIF} vs. 2i/{LIF} revealed differential roles for Nanog, Oct4/Pou5f1, Sox2, Esrrb and Tcf3. Overall, gene expression in the serum/{LIF} condition was more variable than in the 2i/{LIF} but mostly consistent across the two conditions. Expression levels for most genes in single cells were bimodal across the entire population and this motivated a Boolean modeling approach. In silico predictions derived from removal of nodes from the Boolean dynamical model were validated with experimental single and combinatorial {RNA} interference ({RNAi}) knockdowns of selected network components. Quantitative post-{RNAi} expression level measurements of remaining network components showed good agreement with the in silico predictions. Computational removal of nodes from the Boolean network model was also used to predict lineage specification outcomes. In summary, data integration, modeling, and targeted experiments were used to improve our understanding of the regulatory topology that controls {mESC} fate decisions as well as to develop robust directed lineage specification protocols.},

	abstract = {Although haematopoietic stem cells ({HSCs}) are commonly assumed to reside within a specialized microenvironment, or niche, most published experimental manipulations of the {HSC} niche have affected the function of diverse restricted progenitors. This raises the fundamental question of whether {HSCs} and restricted progenitors reside within distinct, specialized niches or whether they share a common niche. Here we assess the physiological sources of the chemokine {CXCL}12 for {HSC} and restricted progenitor maintenance. Cxcl12({DsRed}) knock-in mice ({DsRed}-Express2 recombined into the Cxcl12 locus) showed that Cxcl12 was primarily expressed by perivascular stromal cells and, at lower levels, by endothelial cells, osteoblasts and some haematopoietic cells. Conditional deletion of Cxcl12 from haematopoietic cells or nestin-cre-expressing cells had little or no effect on {HSCs} or restricted progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12 from endothelial cells depleted {HSCs} but not myeloerythroid or lymphoid progenitors. Deletion of Cxcl12 from perivascular stromal cells depleted {HSCs} and certain restricted progenitors and mobilized these cells into circulation. Deletion of Cxcl12 from osteoblasts depleted certain early lymphoid progenitors but not {HSCs} or myeloerythroid progenitors, and did not mobilize these cells into circulation. Different stem and progenitor cells thus reside in distinct cellular niches in bone marrow: {HSCs} occupy a perivascular niche and early lymphoid progenitors occupy an endosteal niche.},

	abstract = {The mammalian lung is a highly branched network in which the distal regions of the bronchial tree transform during development into a densely packed honeycomb of alveolar air sacs that mediate gas exchange. Although this transformation has been studied by marker expression analysis and fate-mapping, the mechanisms that control the progression of lung progenitors along distinct lineages into mature alveolar cell types are still incompletely known, in part because of the limited number of lineage markers and the effects of ensemble averaging in conventional transcriptome analysis experiments on cell populations. Here we show that single-cell transcriptome analysis circumvents these problems and enables direct measurement of the various cell types and hierarchies in the developing lung. We used microfluidic single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) on 198 individual cells at four different stages encompassing alveolar differentiation to measure the transcriptional states which define the developmental and cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We empirically classified cells into distinct groups by using an unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori knowledge of the underlying cell types or the previous purification of cell populations. The results confirmed the basic outlines of the classical model of epithelial cell-type diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of many previously unknown cell-type markers, including transcriptional regulators that discriminate between the different populations. We reconstructed the molecular steps during maturation of bipotential progenitors along both alveolar lineages and elucidated the full life cycle of the alveolar type 2 cell lineage. This single-cell genomics approach is applicable to any developing or mature tissue to robustly delineate molecularly distinct cell types, define progenitors and lineage hierarchies, and identify lineage-specific regulatory factors.},

We will bring together experts in biology, medicine, genomics, technology development and computation (including data analysis, software engineering, and visualization). We will also need standardized experimental and computational methods that will allow us to compare diverse cell and tissue types - and samples across human communities - in consistent ways, ensuring that the resulting resource is truly global. This document, the first version of the {HCA} White Paper, was written by experts in the field with feedback and suggestions from the {HCA} community, gathered during recent international meetings. The White Paper, released at the close of this yearlong planning process, will be a living document that evolves as the {HCA} community provides additional feedback, as technological and computational advances are made, and as lessons are learned during the construction of the atlas.},

To uncover their structural design principles, we defined "network motifs," patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

By experimentally perturbing certain genes, the deconvolution of the true contribution of these genes can also be greatly facilitated. In this chapter, we will therefore tackle the advantages of single-cell transcriptomic data and show how new methods exploit this novel data type to enhance the inference of gene regulatory networks.},

At the same time, this situation has hindered regular adoption of these tools in clinical practice. Typically, they are not sufficiently developed to be used by most clinical researchers and practitioners. To address these issues, it is necessary to re-think how biomedical applications are built and adopt new strategies that ensure quality, efficiency, robustness, correctness and reusability of software components. We also need to engage end-users during the development process to ensure that applications fit their needs.

Substantial differences in biochemical structure were observed between the two types of hubs. Signaling domains were found more often in intermodular hub proteins, which were also more frequently associated with oncogenesis. Analysis of two breast cancer patient cohorts revealed that altered modularity of the human interactome may be useful as an indicator of breast cancer prognosis.},

Since 2014, more than 50 trajectory inference methods have been developed, each with its own set of methodological characteristics. As a result, choosing a method to infer trajectories is often challenging, since a compre-hensive assessment of the performance and robustness of each method is still lacking. In order to facilitate the comparison of the results of these methods to each other and to a gold standard, we developed a global framework to benchmark trajectory inference tools. Using this framework, we compared the trajectories from a total of 29 trajectory inference methods, on a large collection of real and synthetic datasets. We evaluate methods using several metrics, including accuracy of the inferred order-ing, correctness of the network topology, code quality and user friendliness. We found that some methods, including Slingshot, {TSCAN} and Monocle {DDRTree}, clearly outperform other methods, although their performance depended on the type of trajec-tory present in the data. Based on our benchmarking results, we therefore developed a set of guidelines for method users. However, our analysis also indicated that there is still a lot of room for improvement, especially for methods detecting complex trajectory topologies. Our evaluation pipeline can therefore be used to spearhead the development of new scalable and more accurate methods, and is available at github.com/dynverse/dynverse. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive assessment of trajectory inference methods. For now, we exclusively eval-uated the methods on their default parameters, but plan to add a detailed parameter tuning procedure in the future. We gladly welcome any discussion and feedback on key decisions made as part of this study, including the metrics used in the benchmark, the quality control checklist, and the implementation of the method wrappers.

Our data reveal the nature of regulatory elements driving differential gene expression and inform how transcription factor binding impacts on promoter activity. We present a dynamic core regulatory network model for hematopoietic specification and demonstrate its utility for the design of reprogramming experiments.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Several biclustering algorithms have been proposed to identify biclusters, in which genes share similar expression patterns across a number of conditions. However, different algorithms would yield different biclusters and further lead to distinct conclusions. Therefore, some testing and comparisons between these algorithms are strongly required. {METHODS}: In this study, five biclustering algorithms (i.e. {BIMAX}, {FABIA}, {ISA}, {QUBIC} and {SAMBA}) were compared with each other in the cases where they were used to handle two expression datasets ({GDS}1620 and pathway) with different dimensions in Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana){GO} (gene ontology) annotation and {PPI} (protein-protein interaction) network were used to verify the corresponding biological significance of biclusters from the five algorithms. To compare the algorithms' performance and evaluate quality of identified biclusters, two scoring methods, namely weighted enrichment ({WE}) scoring and {PPI} scoring, were proposed in our study. For each dataset, after combining the scores of all biclusters into one unified ranking, we could evaluate the performance and behavior of the five biclustering algorithms in a better way. {RESULTS}: Both {WE} and {PPI} scoring methods has been proved effective to validate biological significance of the biclusters, and a significantly positive correlation between the two sets of scores has been tested to demonstrate the consistence of these two methods.A comparative study of the above five algorithms has revealed that: (1) {ISA} is the most effective one among the five algorithms on the dataset of {GDS}1620 and {BIMAX} outperforms the other algorithms on the dataset of pathway. (2) Both {ISA} and {BIMAX} are data-dependent. The former one does not work well on the datasets with few genes, while the latter one holds well for the datasets with more conditions. (3) {FABIA} and {QUBIC} perform poorly in this study and they may be suitable to large datasets with more genes and more conditions. (4) {SAMBA} is also data-independent as it performs well on two given datasets. The comparison results provide useful information for researchers to choose a suitable algorithm for each given dataset.},

	title = {A novel approach for resolving differences in single-cell gene expression patterns from zygote to blastocyst},
	volume = {28},
	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Single-cell experiments of cells from the early mouse embryo yield gene expression data for different developmental stages from zygote to blastocyst. To better understand cell fate decisions during differentiation, it is desirable to analyse the high-dimensional gene expression data and assess differences in gene expression patterns between different developmental stages as well as within developmental stages. Conventional methods include univariate analyses of distributions of genes at different stages or multivariate linear methods such as principal component analysis ({PCA}). However, these approaches often fail to resolve important differences as each lineage has a unique gene expression pattern which changes gradually over time yielding different gene expressions both between different developmental stages as well as heterogeneous distributions at a specific stage. Furthermore, to date, no approach taking the temporal structure of the data into account has been presented. {RESULTS}: We present a novel framework based on Gaussian process latent variable models ({GPLVMs}) to analyse single-cell {qPCR} expression data of 48 genes from mouse zygote to blastocyst as presented by (Guo et al., 2010). We extend {GPLVMs} by introducing gene relevance maps and gradient plots to provide interpretability as in the linear case. Furthermore, we take the temporal group structure of the data into account and introduce a new factor in the {GPLVM} likelihood which ensures that small distances are preserved for cells from the same developmental stage. Using our novel framework, it is possible to resolve differences in gene expressions for all developmental stages. Furthermore, a new subpopulation of cells within the 16-cell stage is identified which is significantly more trophectoderm-like than the rest of the population. The trophectoderm-like subpopulation was characterized by considerable differences in the expression of Id2, Gata4 and, to a smaller extent, Klf4 and Hand1. The relevance of Id2 as early markers for {TE} cells is consistent with previously published results. {AVAILABILITY}: The mappings were implemented based on Prof. Neil Lawrence's {FGPLVM} toolbox(1); extensions for relevance analysis and including the structure of the data can be obtained from one of the authors' homepage.(2) {CONTACT}: f.buettner@helmholtz-muenchen.de.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Activating mutations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase ({ALK}) were recently described in neuroblastoma. We carried out a meta-analysis of 709 neuroblastoma tumors to determine their frequency and mutation spectrum in relation to genomic and clinical parameters, and studied the prognostic significance of {ALK} copy number and expression. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: The frequency and type of {ALK} mutations, copy number gain, and expression were analyzed in a new series of 254 neuroblastoma tumors. Data from 455 published cases were used for further in-depth analysis. {RESULTS}: {ALK} mutations were present in 6.9\% of 709 investigated tumors, and mutations were found in similar frequencies in favorable [International Neuroblastoma Staging System ({INSS}) 1, 2, and 4S; 5.7\%] and unfavorable ({INSS} 3 and 4; 7.5\%) neuroblastomas (P = 0.087). Two hotspot mutations, at positions R1275 and F1174, were observed (49\% and 34.7\% of the mutated cases, respectively). Interestingly, the F1174 mutations occurred in a high proportion of {MYCN}-amplified cases (P = 0.001), and this combined occurrence was associated with a particular poor outcome, suggesting a positive cooperative effect between both aberrations. Furthermore, the F1174L mutant was characterized by a higher degree of autophosphorylation and a more potent transforming capacity as compared with the R1275Q mutant. Chromosome 2p gains, including the {ALK} locus (91.8\%), were associated with a significantly increased {ALK} expression, which was also correlated with poor survival. {CONCLUSIONS}: {ALK} mutations occur in equal frequencies across all genomic subtypes, but F1174L mutants are observed in a higher frequency of {MYCN}-amplified tumors and show increased transforming capacity as compared with the R1275Q mutants.},

Here, we present a comprehensive transcriptional map of human embryo development, including the sequenced transcriptomes of 1,529 individual cells from 88 human preimplantation embryos. These data show that cells undergo an intermediate state of co-expression of lineage-specific genes, followed by a concurrent establishment of the trophectoderm, epiblast, and primitive endoderm lineages, which coincide with blastocyst formation. Female cells of all three lineages achieve dosage compensation of X chromosome {RNA} levels prior to implantation. However, in contrast to the mouse, {XIST} is transcribed from both alleles throughout the progression of this expression dampening, and X chromosome genes maintain biallelic expression while dosage compensation proceeds. We envision broad utility of this transcriptional atlas in future studies on human development as well as in stem cell research.},

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

Univariate logistic regression analysis was used to select {miRNAs} correlating with {NB} patient survival. A 25-{miRNA} gene signature was built using 51 training samples, tested on 179 test samples, and validated on an independent set of 304 fresh frozen tumor samples and 75 archived {FFPE} samples. {RESULTS}: The 25-{miRNA} signature significantly discriminates the test patients with respect to progression-free and overall survival (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.0001), both in the overall population and in the cohort of high-risk patients. Multivariate analysis indicates that the {miRNA} signature is an independent predictor of patient survival after controlling for current risk factors.

Long noncoding {RNAs} ({lncRNAs}) have emerging roles in epigenetic regulation, but their potential functions in reprogramming cell fate have been largely unexplored. We used single-cell {RNA} sequencing to characterize the expression patterns of over 16,000 genes, including 437 {lncRNAs}, during defined stages of reprogramming to pluripotency. Self-organizing maps ({SOMs}) were used as an intuitive way to structure and interrogate transcriptome data at the single-cell level. Early molecular events during reprogramming involved the activation of Ras signaling pathways, along with hundreds of {lncRNAs}. Loss-of-function studies showed that activated {lncRNAs} can repress lineage-specific genes, while {lncRNAs} activated in multiple reprogramming cell types can regulate metabolic gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that reprogramming cells activate defined sets of functionally relevant {lncRNAs} and provide a resource to further investigate how dynamic changes in the transcriptome reprogram cell state.},

Current state-of-the-art methods can yield models with high variance, rendering them unsuitable for a number of practical applications including {QSAR}. In this paper we describe and evaluate best practices which improve reliability and increase confidence in selected models. A key operational component of the proposed methods is cloud computing which enables routine use of previously infeasible approaches. {METHODS}: We describe in detail an algorithm for repeated grid-search V-fold cross-validation for parameter tuning in classification and regression, and we define a repeated nested cross-validation algorithm for model assessment. As regards variable selection and parameter tuning we define two algorithms (repeated grid-search cross-validation and double cross-validation), and provide arguments for using the repeated grid-search in the general case. {RESULTS}: We show results of our algorithms on seven {QSAR} datasets. The variation of the prediction performance, which is the result of choosing different splits of the dataset in V-fold cross-validation, needs to be taken into account when selecting and assessing classification and regression models. {CONCLUSIONS}: We demonstrate the importance of repeating cross-validation when selecting an optimal model, as well as the importance of repeating nested cross-validation when assessing a prediction error.},

	abstract = {Biological systems are driven by intricate interactions among the complex array of molecules that comprise the cell. Many methods have been developed to reconstruct network models that attempt to capture those interactions. These methods often draw on large numbers of measured expression samples to tease out subtle signals and infer connections between genes (or gene products). The result is an aggregate network model representing a single estimate for edge likelihoods. While informative, aggregate models fail to capture the heterogeneity that is often represented in a population. Here we propose a method to reverse engineer sample-specific networks from aggregate network models. We demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of our approach in several datasets, including simulated data, microarray expression data from synchronized yeast cells, and {RNA}-seq data collected from human subjects. We show that these sample-specific networks can be used to study the evolution of network topology across time and to characterize shifts in gene regulation that may not be apparent in the expression data. We believe the ability to generate sample-specific networks will revolutionize the field of network biology and has the potential to usher in an era of precision network medicine.},

However, as temporal information is lost with such data, mathematical models have been limited to capture only static features of the underlying cellular mechanisms. {RESULTS}: Here, we present a modular framework which allows to recover the temporal behaviour from single-cell snapshot data and reverse engineer the dynamics of gene expression. The framework combines a dimensionality reduction method with a cell time-ordering algorithm to generate pseudo time-series observations. These are in turn used to learn transcriptional {ODE} models and do model selection on structural network features. We apply it on synthetic data and then on real hematopoietic stem cells data, to reconstruct gene expression dynamics during differentiation pathways and infer the structure of a key gene regulatory network. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: C++ and Matlab code available at https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/fileadmin/{ICB}/software/{inferenceSnapshot}.zip.},

We also show how to maintain the h-index itself, and a collection of h high-degree vertices in the graph, in constant time per update. Our data structure has applications in social network analysis using the exponential random graph model ({ERGM}); its bound of O(h) time per edge is never worse than the Theta(sqrt m) time per edge necessary to list all triangles in a static graph, and is strictly better for graphs obeying a power law degree distribution.

	abstract = {Sequencing the transcriptomes of single cells has greatly advanced our understanding of the cellular composition of complex tissues. In many of these systems, the role of heterogeneity has risen to prominence as a determinant of cell type composition and lineage transitions. While much effort has gone into developing appropriate tools for the analysis and comprehension of single cell sequencing data, further advances are required. Optimization-based approaches are under-utilized in single cell analysis and hold much potential due to their ability to capture global properties of the system in low dimension. Here we present {SoptSC}: an optimization-based algorithm for the identification of subpopulation structure, transition paths, and pseudotemporal ordering within a cell population. Based on a measure of similarity between cells, {SoptSC} uses non-negative matrix factorization to create low dimensional representations of the data for analysis and visualization. We find that in several examples, the low-dimensional representations produced by {SoptSC} offer greater potential for insight than alternative methods. We tested our methods on a simulated dataset and four published single cell datasets from Homo sapiens and Mus musculus. {SoptSC} is able to recapitulate a simulated developmental trajectory with greater fidelity than com- parable methods. Applied to two datasets on early embryonic development, {SoptSC} recapitulates known trajectories with high accuracy. Analysis of murine epidermis reveals overall agreement with previous studies, but differs markedly regarding the composition and heterogeneity of the basal compartment. Analysis of murine myelopoiesis found that {SoptSC} can resolve complex hematopoietic subpopulation composition, and led to a new prediction regarding the asynchronous development of myeloid subpopulations during stem cell differentiation.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In recent years, several authors have used probabilistic graphical models to learn expression modules and their regulatory programs from gene expression data. Despite the demonstrated success of such algorithms in uncovering biologically relevant regulatory relations, further developments in the area are hampered by a lack of tools to compare the performance of alternative module network learning strategies. Here, we demonstrate the use of the synthetic data generator {SynTReN} for the purpose of testing and comparing module network learning algorithms. We introduce a software package for learning module networks, called {LeMoNe}, which incorporates a novel strategy for learning regulatory programs. Novelties include the use of a bottom-up Bayesian hierarchical clustering to construct the regulatory programs, and the use of a conditional entropy measure to assign regulators to the regulation program nodes. Using {SynTReN} data, we test the performance of {LeMoNe} in a completely controlled situation and assess the effect of the methodological changes we made with respect to an existing software package, namely Genomica. Additionally, we assess the effect of various parameters, such as the size of the data set and the amount of noise, on the inference performance. {RESULTS}: Overall, application of Genomica and {LeMoNe} to simulated data sets gave comparable results. However, {LeMoNe} offers some advantages, one of them being that the learning process is considerably faster for larger data sets. Additionally, we show that the location of the regulators in the {LeMoNe} regulation programs and their conditional entropy may be used to prioritize regulators for functional validation, and that the combination of the bottom-up clustering strategy with the conditional entropy-based assignment of regulators improves the handling of missing or hidden regulators. {CONCLUSION}: We show that data simulators such as {SynTReN} are very well suited for the purpose of developing, testing and improving module network algorithms. We used {SynTReN} data to develop and test an alternative module network learning strategy, which is incorporated in the software package {LeMoNe}, and we provide evidence that this alternative strategy has several advantages with respect to existing methods.},

New technologies allow for the simultaneous genome-wide assay of the state of genome copy number variation, gene expression, {DNA} methylation and epigenetics of tumor samples and cancer cell lines. Analyses of current data sets find that genetic alterations between patients can differ but often involve common pathways. It is therefore critical to identify relevant pathways involved in cancer progression and detect how they are altered in different patients. {RESULTS}: We present a novel method for inferring patient-specific genetic activities incorporating curated pathway interactions among genes. A gene is modeled by a factor graph as a set of interconnected variables encoding the expression and known activity of a gene and its products, allowing the incorporation of many types of omic data as evidence. The method predicts the degree to which a pathway's activities (e.g. internal gene states, interactions or high-level 'outputs') are altered in the patient using probabilistic inference. Compared with a competing pathway activity inference approach called {SPIA}, our method identifies altered activities in cancer-related pathways with fewer false-positives in both a glioblastoma multiform ({GBM}) and a breast cancer dataset. {PARADIGM} identified consistent pathway-level activities for subsets of the {GBM} patients that are overlooked when genes are considered in isolation. Further, grouping {GBM} patients based on their significant pathway perturbations divides them into clinically-relevant subgroups having significantly different survival outcomes. These findings suggest that therapeutics might be chosen that target genes at critical points in the commonly perturbed pathway(s) of a group of patients. {AVAILABILITY}: Source code available at http://sbenz.github.com/Paradigm,. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The most common application of microarray technology in disease research is to identify genes differentially expressed in disease versus normal tissues. However, it is known that, in complex diseases, phenotypes are determined not only by genes, but also by the underlying structure of genetic networks. Often, it is the interaction of many genes that causes phenotypic variations. {RESULTS}: In this work, using cancer as an example, we develop graph-based methods to integrate multiple microarray datasets to discover disease-related co-expression network modules. We propose an unsupervised method that take into account both co-expression dynamics and network topological information to simultaneously infer network modules and phenotype conditions in which they are activated or de-activated. Using our method, we have discovered network modules specific to cancer or subtypes of cancers. Many of these modules are consistent with or supported by their functional annotations or their previously known involvement in cancer. In particular, we identified a module that is predominately activated in breast cancer and is involved in tumor suppression. While individual components of this module have been suggested to be associated with tumor suppression, their coordinated function has never been elucidated. Here by adopting a network perspective, we have identified their interrelationships and, particularly, a hub gene {PDGFRL} that may play an important role in this tumor suppressor network. {CONCLUSION}: Using a network-based approach, our method provides new insights into the complex cellular mechanisms that characterize cancer and cancer subtypes. By incorporating co-expression dynamics information, our approach can not only extract more functionally homogeneous modules than those based solely on network topology, but also reveal pathway coordination beyond co-expression.},

	volume = {125},
	abstract = {Abnormalities in humoral immunity typically reflect a generalized or selective failure of effective B-cell development. The developmental processes can be followed through analysis of cell-surface markers, such as {IgM}, {IgD}, {CD}10, {CD}19, {CD}20, {CD}21, and {CD}38. Early phases of B-cell development are devoted to the creation of immunoglobulin and testing of B-cell antigen receptor signaling. Failure leads to the absence of B cells and immunoglobulin in the blood from birth. As the developing B cells begin to express a surface B-cell receptor, they become subject to negative and positive selection pressures and increasingly depend on survival signals. Defective signaling can lead to selective or generalized hypogammaglobulinemia, even in the presence of normal numbers of B cells. In the secondary lymphoid organs some B cells enter the splenic marginal zone, where preactivated cells lie ready to rapidly respond to T-independent antigens, such as the polysaccharides that coat some microorganisms. Other cells enter the follicle and, with the aid of cognate follicular T cells, divide to help form a germinal center ({GC}) after their interaction with antigen. In the {GC} B cells can undergo the processes of class switching and somatic hypermutation. Failure to properly receive T-cell signals can lead to hyper-{IgM} syndrome. B cells that leave the {GC} can develop into memory B cells, short-lived plasma cells, or long-lived plasma cells. The latter ultimately migrate back to the bone marrow, where they can continue to produce protective antigen-specific antibodies for decades.},

We examined the ability of {GATA}-1 to repress the expression and function of the {PU}.1 transcription factor, a central regulator of myeloid differentiation. We found that {GATA}-1 is capable of suppressing the myeloid phenotype without interfering with {PU}.1 gene expression, but instead was capable of inhibiting the activity of the {PU}.1 protein in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was independent of the ability of {GATA}-1 to bind {DNA}, suggesting that it is mediated by protein-protein interaction. We examined the ability of {PU}.1 to interact with {GATA}-1 and found a direct interaction between the {PU}.1 {ETS} domain and the C-terminal finger region of {GATA}-1. Replacing the {PU}.1 {ETS} domain with the {GAL}4 {DNA}-binding domain removed the ability of {GATA}-1 to inhibit {PU}.1 activity, indicating that the {PU}.1 {DNA}-binding domain, rather than the transactivation domain, is the target for {GATA}-1-mediated repression. We therefore propose that {GATA}-1 represses myeloid gene expression, at least in part, through its ability to directly interact with the {PU}.1 {ETS} domain and thereby interfere with {PU}.1 function.

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Because susceptibility to diseases increases with age, studying aging gains importance. Analyses of gene expression or sequence data, which have been indispensable for investigating aging, have been limited to studying genes and their protein products in isolation, ignoring their connectivities. However, proteins function by interacting with other proteins, and this is exactly what biological networks ({BNs}) model. Thus, analyzing the proteins' {BN} topologies could contribute to the understanding of aging. Current methods for analyzing systems-level {BNs} deal with their static representations, even though cells are dynamic. For this reason, and because different data types can give complementary biological insights, we integrate current static {BNs} with aging-related gene expression data to construct dynamic age-specific {BNs}. Then, we apply sensitive measures of topology to the dynamic {BNs} to study cellular changes with age.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\${nRESULTS}: While global {BN} topologies do not significantly change with age, local topologies of a number of genes do. We predict such genes to be aging-related. We demonstrate credibility of our predictions by (i) observing significant overlap between our predicted aging-related genes and 'ground truth' aging-related genes; (ii) observing significant overlap between functions and diseases that are enriched in our aging-related predictions and those that are enriched in 'ground truth' aging-related data; (iii) providing evidence that diseases which are enriched in our aging-related predictions are linked to human aging; and (iv) validating our high-scoring novel predictions in the literature.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\${nAVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Software executables are available upon request.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\${nCONTACT}: tmilenko@nd.edu {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Reliable prognostic stratification remains a challenge for cancer patients, especially for diseases with variable clinical course such as neuroblastoma. Although numerous studies have shown that outcome might be predicted using gene expression signatures, independent cross-platform validation is often lacking. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: Using eight independent studies comprising 933 neuroblastoma patients, a prognostic gene expression classifier was developed, trained, tested, and validated. The classifier was established based on reanalysis of four published studies with updated clinical information, reannotation of the probe sequences, common risk definition for training cases, and a single method for gene selection (prediction analysis of microarray) and classification (correlation analysis). {RESULTS}: Based on 250 training samples from four published microarray data sets, a correlation signature was built using 42 robust prognostic genes. The resulting classifier was validated on 351 patients from four independent and unpublished data sets and on 129 remaining test samples from the published studies. Patients with divergent outcome in the total cohort, as well as in the different risk groups, were accurately classified (log-rank P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001 for overall and progression-free survival in the four independent data sets). Moreover, the 42-gene classifier was shown to be an independent predictor for survival (odds ratio, {\textbackslash}textgreater5). {CONCLUSION}: The strength of this 42-gene classifier is its small number of genes and its cross-platform validity in which it outperforms other published prognostic signatures. The robustness and accuracy of the classifier enables prospective assessment of neuroblastoma patient outcome. Most importantly, this gene selection procedure might be an example for development and validation of robust gene expression signatures in other cancer entities.},

	abstract = {Close international collaboration between pediatric oncologists has led to marked improvements in the cure of patients, seen as a long-term overall survival rate of about 80\%. Despite this progress, neuroblastoma remains a challenging disease for both clinicians and researchers. Major clinical problems include lack of acceptable cure rates in high-risk neuroblastoma and potential overtreatment of subsets of patients at low and intermediate risk of the disease. Many years of intensive international cooperation have recently led to a promising joint effort to further improve risk classification for treatment stratification, the new International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Classification System. This approach will facilitate comparison of the results of clinical trials performed by different international collaborative groups. This, in turn, should accelerate refinement of risk stratification and thereby aid selection of appropriate therapies for individual patients. To be able to identify new therapeutic modalities, it will be necessary to elucidate the pathogenesis of the different subtypes of neuroblastoma. Basic and translational research have provided new tools for molecular characterization of blood and tumor samples including high-throughput technologies for analysis of {DNA}, {mRNAs}, {microRNAs} and other non-coding {RNAs}, as well as proteins and epigenetic markers. Most of these studies are array-based in design. In neuroblastoma research they aim to refine risk group stratification through incorporation of molecular tumor fingerprints and also to enable personalized treatment modalities by describing the underlying pathogenesis and aberrant signaling pathways in individual tumors. To make optimal use of these new technologies for the benefit of the patient, it is crucial to have a systematic and detailed documentation of both clinical and molecular data from diagnosis through treatment to follow-up. Close collaboration between clinicians and basic scientists will provide access to combined clinical and molecular data sets and will create more efficient steps in response to the remaining treatment challenges. This review describes the current efforts and trends in neuroblastoma research from a clinical perspective in order to highlight the urgent clinical problems we must address together with basic researchers.},

The method is based on a robust statistical model that describes the complete analysis procedure and allows the computation of essential confidence values for detection of {CNV}. Our results show that the number of reads, not the length of the reads is the key factor determining the resolution of detection. This favors the next-generation sequencing methods that rapidly produce large amount of short reads. {CONCLUSION}: Simulation of various sequencing methods with coverage between 0.1x to 8x show overall specificity between 91.7 - 99.9\%, and sensitivity between 72.2 - 96.5\%.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: This report provides an overview of current childhood cancer statistics to facilitate analysis of the impact of past research discoveries on outcome and provide essential information for prioritizing future research directions. {METHODS}: Incidence and survival data for childhood cancers came from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 9 ({SEER} 9) registries, and mortality data were based on deaths in the United States that were reported by states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by underlying cause. {RESULTS}: Childhood cancer incidence rates increased significantly from 1975 through 2006, with increasing rates for acute lymphoblastic leukemia being most notable. Childhood cancer mortality rates declined by more than 50\% between 1975 and 2006. For leukemias and lymphomas, significantly decreasing mortality rates were observed throughout the 32-year period, though the rate of decline slowed somewhat after 1998. For remaining childhood cancers, significantly decreasing mortality rates were observed from 1975 to 1996, with stable rates from 1996 through 2006. Increased survival rates were observed for all categories of childhood cancers studied, with the extent and temporal pace of the increases varying by diagnosis. {CONCLUSION}: When 1975 age-specific death rates for children are used as a baseline, approximately 38,000 childhood malignant cancer deaths were averted in the United States from 1975 through 2006 as a result of more effective treatments identified and applied during this period. Continued success in reducing childhood cancer mortality will require new treatment paradigms building on an increased understanding of the molecular processes that promote growth and survival of specific childhood cancers.},

Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known–a collaboration network and a food web–and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

Since proteins carry out most biological processes, we focus on analysing protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) networks. Proteins interact to perform a function. Thus, {PPI} networks reflect the interconnected nature of biological processes and analysing their structural properties could provide insights into biological function and disease. We have already demonstrated, by using a sensitive graph theoretic method for comparing topologies of node neighbourhoods called 'graphlet degree signatures', that proteins with similar surroundings in {PPI} networks tend to perform the same functions. Here, we explore whether the involvement of genes in cancer suggests the similarity of their topological 'signatures' as well. By applying a series of clustering methods to proteins' topological signature similarities, we demonstrate that the obtained clusters are significantly enriched with cancer genes. We apply this methodology to identify novel cancer gene candidates, validating 80 per cent of our predictions in the literature. We also validate predictions biologically by identifying cancer-related negative regulators of melanogenesis identified in our {siRNA} screen. This is encouraging, since we have done this solely from {PPI} network topology. We provide clear evidence that {PPI} network structure around cancer genes is different from the structure around non-cancer genes. Understanding the underlying principles of this phenomenon is an open question, with a potential for increasing our understanding of complex diseases.},

By applying {SCUBA} to analyze two complementary, publicly available datasets we successfully reconstructed the cellular hierarchy during early development of mouse embryos, modeled the dynamic changes in gene expression patterns, and predicted the effects of perturbing key transcriptional regulators on inducing lineage biases. The results were robust with respect to experimental platform differences between {RT}-{PCR} and {RNA} sequencing. We selectively tested our predictions in Nanog mutants and found good agreement between {SCUBA} predictions and the experimental data. We further extended the utility of {SCUBA} by developing a method to reconstruct missing temporal-order information from a typical single-cell dataset. Analysis of a hematopoietic dataset suggests that our method is effective for reconstructing gene expression dynamics during human B-cell development. In summary, {SCUBA} provides a useful single-cell data analysis tool that is well-suited for the investigation of developmental processes.},

Single-cell technology helps not only locate cells on this landscape, but illuminates the molecular mechanisms that shape the landscape itself.

As time progresses, computational power increases but well-established inference methods often remain locked in their initial suboptimal solution. {RESULTS}: We revisit the approach of Segal et al. to infer regulatory modules and their condition-specific regulators from gene expression data. In contrast to their direct optimization-based solution, we use a more representative centroid-like solution extracted from an ensemble of possible statistical models to explain the data. The ensemble method automatically selects a subset of most informative genes and builds a quantitatively better model for them. Genes which cluster together in the majority of models produce functionally more coherent modules. Regulators which are consistently assigned to a module are more often supported by literature, but a single model always contains many regulator assignments not supported by the ensemble. Reliably detecting condition-specific or combinatorial regulation is particularly hard in a single optimum but can be achieved using ensemble averaging. {AVAILABILITY}: All software developed for this study is available from http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/software.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: {BACKGROUND}: Accurate outcome prediction in neuroblastoma, which is necessary to enable the optimal choice of risk-related therapy, remains a challenge. To improve neuroblastoma patient stratification, this study aimed to identify prognostic tumor {DNA} methylation biomarkers. {RESULTS}: To identify genes silenced by promoter methylation, we first applied two independent genome-wide methylation screening methodologies to eight neuroblastoma cell lines. Specifically, we used re-expression profiling upon 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ({DAC}) treatment and massively parallel sequencing after capturing with a methyl-{CpG}-binding domain ({MBD}-seq). Putative methylation markers were selected from {DAC}-upregulated genes through a literature search and an upfront methylation-specific {PCR} on 20 primary neuroblastoma tumors, as well as through {MBD}- seq in combination with publicly available neuroblastoma tumor gene expression data. This yielded 43 candidate biomarkers that were subsequently tested by high-throughput methylation-specific {PCR} on an independent cohort of 89 primary neuroblastoma tumors that had been selected for risk classification and survival. Based on this analysis, methylation of {KRT}19, {FAS}, {PRPH}, {CNR}1, {QPCT}, {HIST}1H3C, {ACSS}3 and {GRB}10 was found to be associated with at least one of the classical risk factors, namely age, stage or {MYCN} status. Importantly, {HIST}1H3C and {GNAS} methylation was associated with overall and/or event-free survival. {CONCLUSIONS}: This study combines two genome-wide methylation discovery methodologies and is the most extensive validation study in neuroblastoma performed thus far. We identified several novel prognostic {DNA} methylation markers and provide a basis for the development of a {DNA} methylation-based prognostic classifier in neuroblastoma.},

Tests on simulated benchmarks demonstrate a considerable reduction in computation time for the new method as compared to the usual revised simplex algorithm implemented with state-of-the-art initialization and pivot strategies. As a consequence, the Shortlist Method facilitates the computation of large scale transportation problems in viable time. In addition we describe a novel method for finding an initial feasible solution which we coin Modified Russell's Method.},

	abstract = {Although ultrahigh-throughput {RNA}-Sequencing has become the dominant technology for genome-wide transcriptional profiling, the vast majority of {RNA}-Seq studies typically profile only tens of samples, and most analytical pipelines are optimized for these smaller studies. However, projects are generating ever-larger data sets comprising {RNA}-Seq data from hundreds or thousands of samples, often collected at multiple centers and from diverse tissues. These complex data sets present significant analytical challenges due to batch and tissue effects, but provide the opportunity to revisit the assumptions and methods that we use to preprocess, normalize, and filter {RNA}-Seq data - critical first steps for any subsequent analysis. We find analysis of large {RNA}-Seq data sets requires both careful quality control and that one account for sparsity due to the heterogeneity intrinsic in multi-group studies.

	abstract = {For neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial tumour of childhood, identification of new biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets is mandatory to improve risk stratification and survival rates. {MicroRNAs} are deregulated in most cancers, including neuroblastoma. In this study, we analysed 430 {miRNAs} in 69 neuroblastomas by stem-loop {RT}-{qPCR}. Prediction of event-free survival ({EFS}) with support vector machines ({SVM}) and actual survival times with Cox regression-based models ({CASPAR}) were highly accurate and were independently validated. {SVM}-accuracy for prediction of {EFS} was 88.7\% (95\% {CI}: 88.5-88.8\%). For {CASPAR}-based predictions, 5y-{EFS} probability was 0.19\% (95\% {CI}: 0-38\%) in the {CASPAR}-predicted short survival group compared with 0.78\% (95\%{CI}: 64-93\%) in the {CASPAR}-predicted long survival group. Both classifiers were validated on an independent test set yielding accuracies of 94.74\% ({SVM}) and 5y-{EFS} probabilities as 0.25 (95\% {CI}: 0.0-0.55) for short versus 1 ± 0.0 for long survival ({CASPAR}), respectively. Amplification of the {MYCN} oncogene was highly correlated with deregulation of {miRNA} expression. In addition, 37 {miRNAs} correlated with {TrkA} expression, a marker of excellent outcome, and 6 {miRNAs} further analysed in vitro were regulated upon {TrkA} transfection, suggesting a functional relationship. Expression of the most significant {TrkA}-correlated {miRNA}, {miR}-542-5p, also discriminated between local and metastatic disease and was inversely correlated with {MYCN} amplification and event-free survival. We conclude that neuroblastoma patient outcome prediction using {miRNA} expression is feasible and effective. Studies testing {miRNA}-based predictors in comparison to and in combination with {mRNA} and {aCGH} information should be initiated. Specific {miRNAs} (e.g., {miR}-542-5p) might be important in neuroblastoma tumour biology, and qualify as potential therapeutic targets.},

However, such data offers only a snapshot of the transcriptome, whereas it is often the progression of cells through dynamic biological processes that is of interest. As a result, one outstanding challenge is to infer such progressions by ordering gene expression from single cell data alone, known as the cell ordering problem. Here, we introduce a new method that constructs a low-dimensional non-linear embedding of the data using laplacian eigenmaps before assigning each cell a pseudotime using principal curves. We characterise why on a theoretical level our method is more robust to the high levels of noise typical of single-cell {RNA}-seq data before demonstrating its utility on two existing datasets of differentiating cells.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Over the last decade, a large variety of clustering algorithms have been developed to detect coregulatory relationships among genes from microarray gene expression data. Model-based clustering approaches have emerged as statistically well-grounded methods, but the properties of these algorithms when applied to large-scale data sets are not always well understood. An in-depth analysis can reveal important insights about the performance of the algorithm, the expected quality of the output clusters, and the possibilities for extracting more relevant information out of a particular data set. {RESULTS}: We have extended an existing algorithm for model-based clustering of genes to simultaneously cluster genes and conditions, and used three large compendia of gene expression data for Saccharomyces cerevisiae to analyze its properties. The algorithm uses a Bayesian approach and a Gibbs sampling procedure to iteratively update the cluster assignment of each gene and condition. For large-scale data sets, the posterior distribution is strongly peaked on a limited number of equiprobable clusterings. A {GO} annotation analysis shows that these local maxima are all biologically equally significant, and that simultaneously clustering genes and conditions performs better than only clustering genes and assuming independent conditions. A collection of distinct equivalent clusterings can be summarized as a weighted graph on the set of genes, from which we extract fuzzy, overlapping clusters using a graph spectral method. The cores of these fuzzy clusters contain tight sets of strongly coexpressed genes, while the overlaps exhibit relations between genes showing only partial coexpression. {AVAILABILITY}: {GaneSh}, a Java package for coclustering, is available under the terms of the {GNU} General Public License from our website at http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/software},

We construct a high-resolution map of reprogramming that rediscovers known features; uncovers new alternative cell fates including neural- and placental-like cells; predicts the origin and fate of any cell class; highlights senescent-like cells that may support reprogramming through paracrine signaling; and implicates regulatory models in particular trajectories. Of these findings, we highlight Obox6, which we experimentally show enhances reprogramming efficiency. Our approach provides a general framework for investigating cellular differentiation.},

Hence, to elucidate disease ontology fully and to reduce the cost of drug development, gene regulatory networks ({GRNs}) have to be constructed. During the last decade, many {GRN} inference algorithms based on genome-wide data have been developed to unravel the complexity of gene regulation. Time series transcriptomic data measured by genome-wide {DNA} microarrays are traditionally used for {GRN} modelling. One of the major problems with microarrays is that a dataset consists of relatively few time points with respect to the large number of genes. Dimensionality is one of the interesting problems in {GRN} modelling. {RESULTS}: In this paper, we develop a biclustering function enrichment analysis toolbox ({BicAT}-plus) to study the effect of biclustering in reducing data dimensions. The network generated from our system was validated via available interaction databases and was compared with previous methods. The results revealed the performance of our proposed method. {CONCLUSIONS}: Because of the sparse nature of {GRNs}, the results of biclustering techniques differ significantly from those of previous methods.},

	abstract = {In a classical view of hematopoiesis, the various blood cell lineages arise via a hierarchical scheme starting with multipotent stem cells that become increasingly restricted in their differentiation potential through oligopotent and then unipotent progenitors. We developed a cell-sorting scheme to resolve myeloid (My), erythroid (Er), and megakaryocytic (Mk) fates from single {CD}34(+) cells and then mapped the progenitor hierarchy across human development. Fetal liver contained large numbers of distinct oligopotent progenitors with intermingled My, Er, and Mk fates. However, few oligopotent progenitor intermediates were present in the adult bone marrow. Instead, only two progenitor classes predominate, multipotent and unipotent, with Er-Mk lineages emerging from multipotent cells. The developmental shift to an adult “two-tier” hierarchy challenges current dogma and provides a revised framework to understand normal and disease states of human hematopoiesis.},

However, tools for constructing multi-branching cell lineages from single-cell data are limited. Here we present Mpath, an algorithm that derives multi-branching developmental trajectories using neighborhood-based cell state transitions. Applied to mouse conventional dendritic cell ({cDC}) progenitors, Mpath constructs multi-branching trajectories spanning from macrophage/{DC} progenitors through common {DC} progenitor to pre-dendritic cells ({preDC}). The Mpath-generated trajectories detect a branching event at the {preDC} stage revealing {preDC} subsets that are exclusively committed to {cDC}1 or {cDC}2 lineages. Reordering cells along {cDC} development reveals sequential waves of gene regulation and temporal coupling between cell cycle and {cDC} differentiation. Applied to human myoblasts, Mpath recapitulates the time course of myoblast differentiation and isolates a branch of non-muscle cells involved in the differentiation. Our study shows that Mpath is a useful tool for constructing cell lineages from single-cell data.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Biclustering algorithms for microarray data aim at discovering functionally related gene sets under different subsets of experimental conditions. Due to the problem complexity and the characteristics of microarray datasets, heuristic searches are usually used instead of exhaustive algorithms. Also, the comparison among different techniques is still a challenge. The obtained results vary in relevant features such as the number of genes or conditions, which makes it difficult to carry out a fair comparison. Moreover, existing approaches do not allow the user to specify any preferences on these properties. {RESULTS}: Here, we present the first biclustering algorithm in which it is possible to particularize several biclusters features in terms of different objectives. This can be done by tuning the specified features in the algorithm or also by incorporating new objectives into the search. Furthermore, our approach bases the bicluster evaluation in the use of expression patterns, being able to recognize both shifting and scaling patterns either simultaneously or not. Evolutionary computation has been chosen as the search strategy, naming thus our proposal Evo-Bexpa (Evolutionary Biclustering based in Expression Patterns). {CONCLUSIONS}: We have conducted experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrating Evo-Bexpa abilities to obtain meaningful biclusters. Synthetic experiments have been designed in order to compare Evo-Bexpa performance with other approaches when looking for perfect patterns. Experiments with four different real datasets also confirm the proper performing of our algorithm, whose results have been biologically validated through Gene Ontology.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Complex networks are studied across many fields of science and are particularly important to understand biological processes. Motifs in networks are small connected sub-graphs that occur significantly in higher frequencies than in random networks. They have recently gathered much attention as a useful concept to uncover structural design principles of complex networks. Existing algorithms for finding network motifs are extremely costly in {CPU} time and memory consumption and have practically restrictions on the size of motifs. {RESULTS}: We present a new algorithm (Kavosh), for finding k-size network motifs with less memory and {CPU} time in comparison to other existing algorithms. Our algorithm is based on counting all k-size sub-graphs of a given graph (directed or undirected). We evaluated our algorithm on biological networks of E. coli and S. cereviciae, and also on non-biological networks: a social and an electronic network. {CONCLUSION}: The efficiency of our algorithm is demonstrated by comparing the obtained results with three well-known motif finding tools. For comparison, the {CPU} time, memory usage and the similarities of obtained motifs are considered. Besides, Kavosh can be employed for finding motifs of size greater than eight, while most of the other algorithms have restriction on motifs with size greater than eight.

The International Neuroblastoma Risk Group ({INRG}) classification system was developed to establish a consensus approach for pretreatment risk stratification. {PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS}: The statistical and clinical significance of 13 potential prognostic factors were analyzed in a cohort of 8,800 children diagnosed with {NB} between 1990 and 2002 from North America and Australia (Children's Oncology Group), Europe (International Society of Pediatric Oncology Europe Neuroblastoma Group and German Pediatric Oncology and Hematology Group), and Japan. Survival tree regression analyses using event-free survival ({EFS}) as the primary end point were performed to test the prognostic significance of the 13 factors. {RESULTS}: Stage, age, histologic category, grade of tumor differentiation, the status of the {MYCN} oncogene, chromosome 11q status, and {DNA} ploidy were the most highly statistically significant and clinically relevant factors. A new staging system ({INRG} Staging System) based on clinical criteria and tumor imaging was developed for the {INRG} Classification System. The optimal age cutoff was determined to be between 15 and 19 months, and 18 months was selected for the classification system. Sixteen pretreatment groups were defined on the basis of clinical criteria and statistically significantly different {EFS} of the cohort stratified by the {INRG} criteria. Patients with 5-year {EFS} more than 85\%, more than 75\% to {\textbackslash}textless or = 85\%, {\textbackslash}textgreater or = 50\% to {\textbackslash}textless or = 75\%, or less than 50\% were classified as very low risk, low risk, intermediate risk, or high risk, respectively. {CONCLUSION}: By defining homogenous pretreatment patient cohorts, the {INRG} classification system will greatly facilitate the comparison of risk-based clinical trials conducted in different regions of the world and the development of international collaborative studies.},

	abstract = {Over the years, various computational methodologies have been developed to understand and quantify receptor-ligand interactions. Protein-ligand interactions can also be explained in the form of a network and its properties. The ligand binding at the protein-active site is stabilized by formation of new interactions like hydrogen bond, hydrophobic and ionic. These non-covalent interactions when considered as links cause non-isomorphic sub-graphs in the residue interaction network. This study aims to investigate the relationship between these induced sub-graphs and ligand activity. Graphlet signature-based analysis of networks has been applied in various biological problems; the focus of this work is to analyse protein-ligand interactions in terms of neighbourhood connectivity and to develop a method in which the information from residue interaction networks, i.e. graphlet signatures, can be applied to quantify ligand affinity. A scoring method was developed, which depicts the variability in signatures adopted by different amino acids during inhibitor binding, and was termed as {GSUS} (graphlet signature uniqueness score). The score is specific for every individual inhibitor. Two well-known drug targets, {COX}-2 and {CA}-{II} and their inhibitors, were considered to assess the method. Residue interaction networks of {COX}-2 and {CA}-{II} with their respective inhibitors were used. Only hydrogen bond network was considered to calculate {GSUS} and quantify protein-ligand interaction in terms of graphlet signatures. The correlation of the {GSUS} with {pIC}50 was consistent in both proteins and better in comparison to the Autodock results. The {GSUS} scoring method was better in activity prediction of molecules with similar structure and diverse activity and vice versa. This study can be a major platform in developing approaches that can be used alone or together with existing methods to predict ligand affinity from protein-ligand complexes.},

Evidence is accumulating that during the evolution of vertebrates from early deuterostome ancestors entire genomes were duplicated through two rounds of duplications (the 'one-to-two-to-four' rule). The first genome duplication in chordate evolution might predate the Cambrian explosion. The second genome duplication possibly dates back to the early Devonian. Recent data suggest that later in the Devonian, the fish genome was duplicated for a third time to produce up to eight copies of the original deuterostome genome. This last duplication took place after the two major radiations of jawed vertebrate life, the ray-finned fish (Actinopterygia) and the sarcopterygian lineage, diverged. Therefore the sarcopterygian fish, which includes the coelacanth, lungfish and all land vertebrates such as amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, tend to have only half the number of genes compared with actinopterygian fish. Although many duplicated genes turned into pseudogenes, or even 'junk' {DNA}, many others evolved new functions particularly during development. The increased genetic complexity of fish might reflect their evolutionary success and diversity.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: A myriad of methods to reverse-engineer transcriptional regulatory networks have been developed in recent years. Direct methods directly reconstruct a network of pairwise regulatory interactions while module-based methods predict a set of regulators for modules of coexpressed genes treated as a single unit. To date, there has been no systematic comparison of the relative strengths and weaknesses of both types of methods. {RESULTS}: We have compared a recently developed module-based algorithm, {LeMoNe} (Learning Module Networks), to a mutual information based direct algorithm, {CLR} (Context Likelihood of Relatedness), using benchmark expression data and databases of known transcriptional regulatory interactions for Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A global comparison using recall versus precision curves hides the topologically distinct nature of the inferred networks and is not informative about the specific subtasks for which each method is most suited. Analysis of the degree distributions and a regulator specific comparison show that {CLR} is 'regulator-centric', making true predictions for a higher number of regulators, while {LeMoNe} is 'target-centric', recovering a higher number of known targets for fewer regulators, with limited overlap in the predicted interactions between both methods. Detailed biological examples in E. coli and S. cerevisiae are used to illustrate these differences and to prove that each method is able to infer parts of the network where the other fails. Biological validation of the inferred networks cautions against over-interpreting recall and precision values computed using incomplete reference networks. {CONCLUSION}: Our results indicate that module-based and direct methods retrieve largely distinct parts of the underlying transcriptional regulatory networks. The choice of algorithm should therefore be based on the particular biological problem of interest and not on global metrics which cannot be transferred between organisms. The development of sound statistical methods for integrating the predictions of different reverse-engineering strategies emerges as an important challenge for future research.},

	abstract = {The inference of biological networks is an active research area in the field of systems biology. The number of network inference algorithms has grown tremendously in the last decade, underlining the importance of a fair assessment and comparison among these methods. Current assessments of the performance of an inference method typically involve the application of the algorithm to benchmark datasets and the comparison of the network predictions against the gold standard or reference networks. While the network inference problem is often deemed underdetermined, implying that the inference problem does not have a (unique) solution, the consequences of such an attribute have not been rigorously taken into consideration. Here, we propose a new procedure for assessing the performance of gene regulatory network ({GRN}) inference methods. The procedure takes into account the underdetermined nature of the inference problem, in which gene regulatory interactions that are inferable or non-inferable are determined based on causal inference. The assessment relies on a new definition of the confusion matrix, which excludes errors associated with non-inferable gene regulations. For demonstration purposes, the proposed assessment procedure is applied to the {DREAM} 4 In Silico Network Challenge. The results show a marked change in the ranking of participating methods when taking network inferability into account.},

Segmental chromosome alterations were observed in 11\%, 20\% and 59\% of infants enroled in trials {INES}99.1 (localised unresectable {NB}), {INES}99.2 (stage 4s) and {INES}99.3 (stage 4) (P{\textbackslash}textless0.0001).

	abstract = {Although individual tumors of the same clinical type have surprisingly diverse genomic alterations, these events tend to occur in a limited number of pathways, and alterations that affect the same pathway tend to not co-occur in the same patient. While pathway analysis has been a powerful tool in cancer genomics, our knowledge of oncogenic pathway modules is incomplete. To systematically identify such modules, we have developed a novel method, Mutual Exclusivity Modules in cancer ({MEMo}). The method uses correlation analysis and statistical tests to identify network modules by three criteria: (1) Member genes are recurrently altered across a set of tumor samples; (2) member genes are known to or are likely to participate in the same biological process; and (3) alteration events within the modules are mutually exclusive. Applied to data from the Cancer Genome Atlas ({TCGA}), the method identifies the principal known altered modules in glioblastoma ({GBM}) and highlights the striking mutual exclusivity of genomic alterations in the {PI}(3)K, p53, and Rb pathways. In serous ovarian cancer, we make the novel observation that inactivation of {BRCA}1 and {BRCA}2 is mutually exclusive of amplification of {CCNE}1 and inactivation of {RB}1, suggesting distinct alternative causes of genomic instability in this cancer type; and, we identify {RBBP}8 as a candidate oncogene involved in Rb-mediated cell cycle control. When applied to any cancer genomics data set, the algorithm can nominate oncogenic alterations that have a particularly strong selective effect and may also be useful in the design of therapeutic combinations in cases where mutual exclusivity reflects synthetic lethality.},

In addition, the cost of cure can be quite high, as surviving children remain at risk for additional health problems related to long-term toxicities of treatment. Further advances in therapy will require the targeting of tumor cells in a more selective and efficient way so that survival can be improved without substantially increasing toxicity.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {DNA} methylation plays an important role in development and tumorigenesis by epigenetic modification and silencing of critical genes. The development of {PCR}-based methylation assays on bisulphite modified {DNA} heralded a breakthrough in speed and sensitivity for gene methylation analysis. Despite this technological advancement, these approaches require a cumbersome gene by gene primer design and experimental validation. Bisulphite {DNA} modification results in sequence alterations (all unmethylated cytosines are converted into uracils) and a general sequence complexity reduction as cytosines become underrepresented. Consequently, standard {BLAST} sequence homology searches cannot be applied to search for specific methylation primers. {RESULTS}: To address this problem we developed {methBLAST}, a sequence similarity search program, based on the original {BLAST} algorithm but querying in silico bisulphite modified genome sequences to evaluate oligonucleotide sequence similarities. Apart from the primer specificity analysis tool, we have also developed a public database termed {methPrimerDB} for the storage and retrieval of validated {PCR} based methylation assays. The web interface allows free public access to perform {methBLAST} searches or database queries and to submit user based information. Database records can be searched by gene symbol, nucleotide sequence, analytical method used, Entrez Gene or {methPrimerDB} identifier, and submitter's name. Each record contains a link to Entrez Gene and {PubMed} to retrieve additional information on the gene, its genomic context and the article in which the methylation assay was described. To assure and maintain data integrity and accuracy, the database is linked to other reference databases. Currently, the database contains primer records for the most popular {PCR}-based methylation analysis methods to study human, mouse and rat epigenetic modifications. {methPrimerDB} and {methBLAST} are available at http://medgen.ugent.be/methprimerdb and http://medgen.ugent.be/methblast. {CONCLUSION}: We have developed two integrated and freely available web-tools for {PCR} based methylation analysis. {methBLAST} allows in silico assessment of primer specificity in {PCR} based methylation assays that can be stored in the {methPrimerDB} database, which provides a search portal for validated methylation assays.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Single-cell technologies have recently gained popularity in cellular differentiation studies regarding their ability to resolve potential heterogeneities in cell populations. Analyzing such high-dimensional single-cell data has its own statistical and computational challenges. Popular multivariate approaches are based on data normalization, followed by dimension reduction and clustering to identify subgroups. However, in the case of cellular differentiation, we would not expect clear clusters to be present but instead expect the cells to follow continuous branching lineages. {RESULTS}: Here, we propose the use of diffusion maps to deal with the problem of defining differentiation trajectories. We adapt this method to single-cell data by adequate choice of kernel width and inclusion of uncertainties or missing measurement values, which enables the establishment of a pseudotemporal ordering of single cells in a high-dimensional gene expression space. We expect this output to reflect cell differentiation trajectories, where the data originates from intrinsic diffusion-like dynamics. Starting from a pluripotent stage, cells move smoothly within the transcriptional landscape towards more differentiated states with some stochasticity along their path. We demonstrate the robustness of our method with respect to extrinsic noise (e.g. measurement noise) and sampling density heterogeneities on simulated toy data as well as two single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reaction datasets (i.e. mouse haematopoietic stem cells and mouse embryonic stem cells) and an {RNA}-Seq data of human pre-implantation embryos. We show that diffusion maps perform considerably better than Principal Component Analysis and are advantageous over other techniques for non-linear dimension reduction such as t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding for preserving the global structures and pseudotemporal ordering of cells. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: The Matlab implementation of diffusion maps for single-cell data is available at https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/single-cell-diffusion-map. {CONTACT}: fbuettner.phys@gmail.com, fabian.theis@helmholtz-muenchen.de {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {In multicellular organisms, biological function emerges when heterogeneous cell types form complex organs. Nevertheless, dissection of tissues into mixtures of cellular subpopulations is currently challenging. We introduce an automated massively parallel single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) approach for analyzing in vivo transcriptional states in thousands of single cells. Combined with unsupervised classification algorithms, this facilitates ab initio cell-type characterization of splenic tissues. Modeling single-cell transcriptional states in dendritic cells and additional hematopoietic cell types uncovers rich cell-type heterogeneity and gene-modules activity in steady state and after pathogen activation. Cellular diversity is thereby approached through inference of variable and dynamic pathway activity rather than a fixed preprogrammed cell-type hierarchy. These data demonstrate single-cell {RNA}-seq as an effective tool for comprehensive cellular decomposition of complex tissues.},

Methods that allow imaging and identification of nascent proteins are critical for dissecting regulation of translation, both spatially and temporally, particularly in whole organisms. We introduce a simple and robust chemical method to image and affinity-purify nascent proteins in cells and in animals, based on an alkyne analog of puromycin, O-propargyl-puromycin ({OP}-puro). {OP}-puro forms covalent conjugates with nascent polypeptide chains, which are rapidly turned over by the proteasome and can be visualized or captured by copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Unlike methionine analogs, {OP}-puro does not require methionine-free conditions and, uniquely, can be used to label and assay nascent proteins in whole organisms. This strategy should have broad applicability for imaging protein synthesis and for identifying proteins synthesized under various physiological and pathological conditions in vivo.},

Computational techniques have arisen from areas such as single-cell 'omics and in cancer modelling where pseudotime can be used to learn about cellular differentiation or tumour progression. However, methods to date typically assume homogenous genetic and environmental backgrounds, which becomes particularly limiting as datasets grow in size and complexity. As a solution to this we describe a novel statistical framework that learns pseudotime trajectories in the presence of non-homogeneous genetic, phenotypic, or environmental backgrounds. We demonstrate that this enables us to identify interactions between such factors and the underlying genomic trajectory. By applying this model to both single-cell gene expression data and population level cancer studies we show that it uncovers known and novel interaction effects between genetic and enironmental factors and the expression of genes in pathways.

Although not frequent in absolute terms, neuroblastoma represents an important clinical challenge, as it is fatal in almost half of the patients despite advances in multimodal anti-cancer therapies. Four major risk stratification systems for neuroblastoma patients are currently being used in various parts of the world. Systems are based on a combination of various clinical, histopathological, and biological factors. Accordingly, different therapeutic schemes exist ranging from wait-and-see approaches to intensive multimodal therapies. Clinical experience with the currently used risk stratification systems suggests that the stratification of patients for treatment is useful, but patients with the same clinico-pathological parameters, receiving the same treatment, can have markedly different clinical courses. Therefore, the challenge remains to identify additional tumor-specific and sensitive prognostic markers for improved risk estimation at the time of diagnosis and to improve the choice of risk-related therapy. Various studies have put forward new prognostic markers, including copy number aberrations, gene expression signatures, and epigenetic markers.},

The smoothers are constructed by a simple transformation and truncation of the basis that arises from the solution of the thin plate spline smoothing problem and are optimal in the sense that the truncation is designed to result in the minimum possible perturbation of the thin plate spline smoothing problem given the dimension of the basis used to construct the smoother. By making use of Lanczos iteration the basis change and truncation are computationally efficient. The smoothers allow the use of approximate thin plate spline models with large data sets, avoid the problems that are associated with `knot placement' that usually complicate modelling with regression splines or penalized regression splines, provide a sensible way of modelling interaction terms in generalized additive models, provide low rank approximations to generalized smoothing spline models, appropriate for use with large data sets, provide a means for incorporating smooth functions of more than one variable into non-linear models and improve the computational efficiency of penalized likelihood models incorporating thin plate splines. Given that the approach produces spline-like models with a sparse basis, it also provides a natural way of incorporating unpenalized spline-like terms in linear and generalized linear models, and these can be treated just like any other model terms from the point of view of model selection, inference and diagnostics.},

Using the yeast transcriptional regulatory network as a test case, we show that extracted modules have a biologically plausible connectivity because they preserve functional and structural properties of the original network.

Here, we review the technological developments and experimental designs that have enabled differential network mapping at very large scales and highlight biological insight that has been derived from this type of analysis.

Despite a strong understanding of the role noise plays in synthetic biological systems, it remains unclear how propagation of expression heterogeneity in an endogenous regulatory network is distributed and utilized by cells transitioning through a key developmental event. {RESULTS}: Here we investigate the temporal dynamics of a single-cell transcriptional network of 45 transcription factors in {THP}-1 human myeloid monocytic leukemia cells undergoing differentiation to macrophages. We systematically measure temporal regulation of expression and variation by profiling 120 single cells at eight distinct time points, and infer highly controlled regulatory modules through which signaling operates with stochastic effects. This reveals dynamic and specific rewiring as a cellular strategy for differentiation. The integration of both positive and negative co-expression networks further identifies the proto-oncogene {MYB} as a network hinge to modulate both the pro- and anti-differentiation pathways. {CONCLUSIONS}: Compared to averaged cell populations, temporal single-cell expression profiling provides a much more powerful technique to probe for mechanistic insights underlying cellular differentiation.

Tumors presenting exclusively whole-chromosome copy number variations were associated with excellent survival. No disease-related death was observed in this group. In contrast, tumors with any type of segmental chromosome alterations characterized patients with a high risk of relapse. Patients with both numerical and segmental abnormalities clearly shared the higher risk of relapse of segmental-only patients. In a multivariate analysis, taking into account the genomic profile, but also previously described individual genetic and clinical markers with prognostic significance, the presence of segmental alterations with ({HR}, 7.3; 95\% {CI}, 3.7 to 14.5; P {\textbackslash}textless .001) or without {MYCN} amplification ({HR}, 4.5; 95\% {CI}, 2.4 to 8.4; P {\textbackslash}textless .001) was the strongest predictor of relapse; the other significant variables were age older than 18 months ({HR}, 1.8; 95\% {CI}, 1.2 to 2.8; P = .004) and stage 4 ({HR}, 1.8; 95\% {CI}, 1.2 to 2.7; P = .005). Finally, within tumors showing segmental alterations, stage 4, age, {MYCN} amplification, 1p and 11q deletions, and 1q gain were independent predictors of decreased overall survival. {CONCLUSION}: The analysis of the overall genomic pattern, which probably unravels particular genomic instability mechanisms rather than the analysis of individual markers, is essential to predict relapse in {NB} patients. It adds critical prognostic information to conventional markers and should be included in future treatment stratification.},

Normal brain function relies on a diverse set of differentiated cell types, including neurons, glia, and vasculature. Here, we have used large-scale single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) to classify cells in the mouse somatosensory cortex and hippocampal {CA}1 region. We found 47 molecularly distinct subclasses, comprising all known major cell types in the cortex. We identified numerous marker genes, which allowed alignment with known cell types, morphology, and location. We found a layer I interneuron expressing Pax6 and a distinct postmitotic oligodendrocyte subclass marked by Itpr2. Across the diversity of cortical cell types, transcription factors formed a complex, layered regulatory code, suggesting a mechanism for the maintenance of adult cell type identity.},

	abstract = {A central question in biology is whether variability between genetically identical cells exposed to the same culture conditions is largely stochastic or deterministic. Using image-based transcriptomics in millions of single human cells, we find that while variability of cytoplasmic transcript abundance is large, it is for most genes minimally stochastic and can be predicted with multivariate models of the phenotypic state and population context of single cells. Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and experimental validation show that nuclear retention and transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional fluctuations in mammalian gene expression. Our work indicates that cellular compartmentalization confines transcriptional noise to the nucleus, thereby preventing it from interfering with the control of single-cell transcript abundance in the cytoplasm.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To optimize neuroblastoma treatment stratification, we aimed at developing a novel risk estimation system by integrating gene expression-based classification and established prognostic markers. Material and Methods: Gene expression profiles were generated from 709 neuroblastoma specimens using customized 4x44K microarrays. Classification models were built using 75 tumors with contrasting courses of disease. Validation was performed in an independent test set (n=634) by Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression analyses. Results: The best-performing classifier predicted patient outcome with an accuracy of 0.95 (sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.97) in the validation cohort. The highest potential clinical value of this predictor was observed for current low-risk patients ({LR}: 5-year {EFS} 0.84±0.02 vs 0.29±0.10; 5-year {OS} 0.99±0.01vs 0.76±0.11; both p{\textbackslash}textless0.001) and intermediate-risk patients ({IR}: 5-year {EFS} 0.88±0.06 vs 0.41±0.10; 5-year {OS} 1.0 vs 0.70±0.09; both p{\textbackslash}textless0.001). In multivariate Cox regression models for {LR}/{IR} patients the classifier outperformed risk assessment of the current German trial {NB}2004 ({EFS}: {HR} 5.07, 95\%-{CI} 3.20-8.02, {OS}: {HR} 25.54, 95\%-{CI} 8.40-77.66; both p{\textbackslash}textless0.001). Based on these findings, we propose to integrate the classifier into a revised risk stratification system for {LR}/{IR} patients. According to this system, we identified novel subgroups with poor outcome (5-year {EFS} 0.19±0.08; 5-year {OS} 0.59±0.1), for whom we propose intensified treatment, and with beneficial outcome (5-year {EFS} 0.87±0.05; 5-year {OS} 1.0), who may benefit from treatment de-escalation. Conclusion: Combination of gene expression-based classification and established prognostic markers improves risk estimation of {LR}/{IR} neuroblastoma patients. We propose to implement our revised treatment stratification system in a prospective clinical trial.},

	abstract = {Deletions of chromosome 3p are frequent in many types of neoplasia including neural crest tumours such as neuroblastoma ({NB}) and phaeochromocytoma. Recently we isolated several candidate tumour suppressor genes ({TSGs}) from a 120 kb critical interval at 3p21.3 defined by overlapping homozygous deletions in lung and breast tumour lines. Although mutation analysis of candidate {TSGs} in lung and breast cancers revealed only rare mutations, expression of one of the genes ({RASSF}1A) was absent in the majority of lung tumour cell lines analysed. Subsequently methylation of a {CpG} island in the promoter region of {RASSF}1A was demonstrated in a majority of small cell lung carcinomas and to a lesser extent in non-small cell lung carcinomas. To investigate the role of 3p {TSGs} in neural crest tumours, we (a) analysed phaeochromocytomas for 3p allele loss (n=41) and {RASSF}1A methylation (n=23) and (b) investigated 67 neuroblastomas for {RASSF}1A inactivation. 46\% of phaeochromocytomas showed 3p allele loss (38.5\% at 3p21.3). {RASSF}1A promoter region hypermethylation was found in 22\% (5/23) of sporadic phaeochromocytomas and in 55\% (37/67) of neuroblastomas analysed but {RASSF}1A mutations were not identified. In two neuroblastoma cell lines, methylation of {RASSF}1A correlated with loss of {RASSF}1A expression and {RASSF}1A expression was restored after treatment with the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine. As frequent methylation of the {CASP}8 gene has also been reported in neuroblastoma, we investigated whether {RASSF}1A and {CASP}8 methylation were independent or related events. {CASP}8 methylation was detected in 56\% of neuroblastomas with {RASSF}1A methylation and 17\% without {RASSF}1A methylation (P=0.0031). These results indicate that (a) {RASSF}1A inactivation by hypermethylation is a frequent event in neural crest tumorigenesis, particularly neuroblastoma, and that {RASSF}1A is a candidate 3p21.3 neuroblastoma {TSG} and (b) a subset of neuroblastomas may be characterized by a {CpG} island methylator phenotype.},

	abstract = {{DNA} microarray technologies are used extensively to profile the expression levels of thousands of genes under various conditions, yielding extremely large data-matrices. Thus, analyzing this information and extracting biologically relevant knowledge becomes a considerable challenge. A classical approach for tackling this challenge is to use clustering (also known as one-way clustering) methods where genes (or respectively samples) are grouped together based on the similarity of their expression profiles across the set of all samples (or respectively genes). An alternative approach is to develop biclustering methods to identify local patterns in the data. These methods extract subgroups of genes that are co-expressed across only a subset of samples and may feature important biological or medical implications. In this study we evaluate 13 biclustering and 2 clustering (k-means and hierarchical) methods. We use several approaches to compare their performance on two real gene expression data sets. For this purpose we apply four evaluation measures in our analysis: (1) we examine how well the considered (bi)clustering methods differentiate various sample types; (2) we evaluate how well the groups of genes discovered by the (bi)clustering methods are annotated with similar Gene Ontology categories; (3) we evaluate the capability of the methods to differentiate genes that are known to be specific to the particular sample types we study and (4) we compare the running time of the algorithms. In the end, we conclude that as long as the samples are well defined and annotated, the contamination of the samples is limited, and the samples are well replicated, biclustering methods such as Plaid and {SAMBA} are useful for discovering relevant subsets of genes and samples.},

The first issue is to develop new analysis methods for high-dimensional data that can directly reveal and quantify important characteristics associated with complex cellular biology. The other issue is to replace subjective and inaccurate gating with automated methods that objectively define subpopulations and account for population overlap due to measurement uncertainty. Probability state modeling ({PSM}) is a technique that addresses both of these issues. The theory and important algorithms associated with {PSM} are presented along with simple examples and general strategies for autonomous analyses. {PSM} is leveraged to better understand B-cell ontogeny in bone marrow in a companion Cytometry Part B manuscript. Three short relevant videos are available in the online supporting information for both of these papers. {PSM} avoids the dimensionality barrier normally associated with high-dimensionality modeling by using broadened quantile functions instead of frequency functions to represent the modulation of cellular epitopes as cells differentiate. Since modeling programs ultimately minimize or maximize one or more objective functions, they are particularly amenable to automation and, therefore, represent a viable alternative to subjective and inaccurate gating approaches.},

The challenges, based on anonymized data sets, tested participants in network inference and prediction of measurements. Forty teams submitted 413 predicted networks and measurement test sets. Overall, a handful of best-performer teams were identified, while a majority of teams made predictions that were equivalent to random. Counterintuitively, combining the predictions of multiple teams (including the weaker teams) can in some cases improve predictive power beyond that of any single method. {CONCLUSIONS}: {DREAM} provides valuable feedback to practitioners of systems biology modeling. Lessons learned from the predictions of the community provide much-needed context for interpreting claims of efficacy of algorithms described in the scientific literature.},

	abstract = {It is currently thought that life-long blood cell production is driven by the action of a small number of multipotent haematopoietic stem cells. Evidence supporting this view has been largely acquired through the use of functional assays involving transplantation. However, whether these mechanisms also govern native non-transplant haematopoiesis is entirely unclear. Here we have established a novel experimental model in mice where cells can be uniquely and genetically labelled in situ to address this question. Using this approach, we have performed longitudinal analyses of clonal dynamics in adult mice that reveal unprecedented features of native haematopoiesis. In contrast to what occurs following transplantation, steady-state blood production is maintained by the successive recruitment of thousands of clones, each with a minimal contribution to mature progeny. Our results demonstrate that a large number of long-lived progenitors, rather than classically defined haematopoietic stem cells, are the main drivers of steady-state haematopoiesis during most of adulthood. Our results also have implications for understanding the cellular origin of haematopoietic disease.},

Recent evaluations, however, have shown that dedicated {scRNA}-seq tools provide no advantage compared to traditional bulk {RNA}-seq tools.

In this review, we cover one of the most promising avenues of research into unlocking the potential of {scRNA}-seq data: the field of manifold learning, and the related manifold assumption in data analysis. Manifold learning provides a powerful structure for algorithmic approaches to process the data, extract its dynamics, and infer patterns in it. In particular, we cover manifold learning-based methods for denoising the data, revealing gene interactions, extracting pseudotime progressions with model fitting, visualizing the cellular state space via dimensionality reduction, and clustering the data.},

We also observed a continuum of stemness-related expression states that enabled us to identify putative regulators of stemness in vivo. Finally, we show that established glioblastoma subtype classifiers are variably expressed across individual cells within a tumor and demonstrate the potential prognostic implications of such intratumoral heterogeneity.

The system is built with 82 complete genomes organized into gene families and subfamilies, and their evolutionary relationships are captured in phylogenetic trees, multiple sequence alignments and statistical models (hidden Markov models or {HMMs}). Genes are classified according to their function in several different ways: families and subfamilies are annotated with ontology terms (Gene Ontology ({GO}) and {PANTHER} protein class), and sequences are assigned to {PANTHER} pathways. The {PANTHER} website includes a suite of tools that enable users to browse and query gene functions, and to analyze large-scale experimental data with a number of statistical tests. It is widely used by bench scientists, bioinformaticians, computer scientists and systems biologists. In the 2013 release of {PANTHER} (v.8.0), in addition to an update of the data content, we redesigned the website interface to improve both user experience and the system's analytical capability.

Analysis of tumors by comparative genomic hybridization revealed gains and losses of at least seven chromosomal regions, all of which are syntenic with comparable abnormalities detected in human neuroblastomas. In addition, we have shown that increases in {MYCN} dosage or deficiencies in either of the tumor suppressor genes {NF}1 or {RB}1 can augment tumorigenesis by the transgene. Our results provide direct evidence that {MYCN} can contribute to the genesis of neuroblastoma, suggest that the genetic events involved in the genesis of neuroblastoma can be tumorigenic in more than one chronological sequence, and offer a model for further study of the pathogenesis and therapy of neuroblastoma.},

	abstract = {Since the publication of the human reference genome, the identities of specific genes associated with human diseases are being discovered at a rapid rate. A central problem is that the biological activity of these genes is often unclear. Detailed investigations in model vertebrate organisms, typically mice, have been essential for understanding the activities of many orthologues of these disease-associated genes. Although gene-targeting approaches and phenotype analysis have led to a detailed understanding of nearly 6,000 protein-coding genes, this number falls considerably short of the more than 22,000 mouse protein-coding genes. Similarly, in zebrafish genetics, one-by-one gene studies using positional cloning, insertional mutagenesis, antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, targeted re-sequencing, and zinc finger and {TAL} endonucleases have made substantial contributions to our understanding of the biological activity of vertebrate genes, but again the number of genes studied falls well short of the more than 26,000 zebrafish protein-coding genes. Importantly, for both mice and zebrafish, none of these strategies are particularly suited to the rapid generation of knockouts in thousands of genes and the assessment of their biological activity. Here we describe an active project that aims to identify and phenotype the disruptive mutations in every zebrafish protein-coding gene, using a well-annotated zebrafish reference genome sequence, high-throughput sequencing and efficient chemical mutagenesis. So far we have identified potentially disruptive mutations in more than 38\% of all known zebrafish protein-coding genes. We have developed a multi-allelic phenotyping scheme to efficiently assess the effects of each allele during embryogenesis and have analysed the phenotypic consequences of over 1,000 alleles. All mutant alleles and data are available to the community and our phenotyping scheme is adaptable to phenotypic analysis beyond embryogenesis.},

Recent findings support the notion that distinct subsets of classical {DCs} favor alternative modules of immunity, acting on innate lymphoid-like cells ({ILCs}) and T cells similarly to promote either {ILC}1/Th1/{CTL}- or {ILC}3/Th17-type responses. Coordination between {DC} subsets and their favored immune module might imply that the genetic programs for {DC} diversification preceded the emergence of recombination-activating gene-dependent adaptive immunity and operate initially in coordinating {ILC} repertoires for appropriate responses against pathogens. Consequently, understanding the molecular basis of {DC} developmental and diversification is important for an underlying appreciation of immune regulation. Currently, the basis for {DC} development into the recognized subsets/lineages is only partially understood, based on the requirements for several transcription factors including {PU}.1, Bcl11a, Irf8, E2-2, Id2, Irf4, Irf8, Batf3, and other {BATF} family members.

	abstract = {Identifying genes related to human diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular disease, etc., is an important task in biomedical research because of its applications in disease diagnosis and treatment. Interactome networks, especially protein-protein interaction networks, had been used to disease genes identification based on the hypothesis that strong candidate genes tend to closely relate to each other in some kinds of measure on the network. We proposed a new measure to analyze the relationship between network nodes which was called graphlet interaction. The graphlet interaction contained 28 different isomers. The results showed that the numbers of the graphlet interaction isomers between disease genes in interactome networks were significantly larger than random picked genes, while graphlet signatures were not. Then, we designed a new type of score, based on the network properties, to identify disease genes using graphlet interaction. The genes with higher scores were more likely to be disease genes, and all candidate genes were ranked according to their scores. Then the approach was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation. The precision of the current approach achieved 90\% at about 10\% recall, which was apparently higher than the previous three predominant algorithms, random walk, Endeavour and neighborhood based method. Finally, the approach was applied to predict new disease genes related to 4 common diseases, most of which were identified by other independent experimental researches. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the graphlet interaction is an effective tool to analyze the network properties of disease genes, and the scores calculated by graphlet interaction is more precise in identifying disease genes.},

	abstract = {Neuroblastoma is the most common pediatric extracranial soft-tissue tumor, accounting for approximately 8\% of childhood malignancies. Its prognosis is widely variable, ranging from spontaneous regression to fatal disease despite multimodality therapy. Multiple imaging and clinical tests are needed to accurately assess patient risk with risk groups based on disease stage, patient age, and biological tumor factors. Approximately 60\% of patients with neuroblastoma have metastatic disease, most commonly involving bone marrow or cortical bone. Metaiodobenzylguanidine ({mIBG}) scintigraphy plays an important role in the assessment of neuroblastoma, allowing whole-body disease assessment. {mIBG} is used to define extent of disease at diagnosis, assess disease response during therapy, and detect residual and recurrent disease during follow-up. {mIBG} is highly sensitive and specific for neuroblastoma, concentrating in {\textbackslash}textgreater90\% of tumors. {mIBG} was initially labeled with (131)I, but (123)I-{mIBG} yields higher quality images at a lower patient radiation dose. (123)I-{mIBG} ({AdreView}; {GE} Healthcare, Arlington Heights, {IL}) was approved for clinical use in children by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008 and is now commercially available throughout the United States. The use of single-photon emission computed tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography in (123)I-{mIBG} imaging has improved certainty of lesion detection and localization. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography has recently been compared with {mIBG} and found to be most useful in neuroblastomas which fail to or weakly accumulate {mIBG}.},

	abstract = {The blood system is sustained by a pool of haematopoietic stem cells ({HSCs}) that are long-lived due to their capacity for self-renewal. A consequence of longevity is exposure to stress stimuli including reactive oxygen species ({ROS}), nutrient fluctuation and {DNA} damage. Damage that occurs within stressed {HSCs} must be tightly controlled to prevent either loss of function or the clonal persistence of oncogenic mutations that increase the risk of leukaemogenesis. Despite the importance of maintaining cell integrity throughout life, how the {HSC} pool achieves this and how individual {HSCs} respond to stress remain poorly understood. Many sources of stress cause misfolded protein accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER}), and subsequent activation of the unfolded protein response ({UPR}) enables the cell to either resolve stress or initiate apoptosis. Here we show that human {HSCs} are predisposed to apoptosis through strong activation of the {PERK} branch of the {UPR} after {ER} stress, whereas closely related progenitors exhibit an adaptive response leading to their survival. Enhanced {ER} protein folding by overexpression of the co-chaperone {ERDJ}4 (also called {DNAJB}9) increases {HSC} repopulation capacity in xenograft assays, linking the {UPR} to {HSC} function. Because the {UPR} is a focal point where different sources of stress converge, our study provides a framework for understanding how stress signalling is coordinated within tissue hierarchies and integrated with stemness. Broadly, these findings reveal that the {HSC} pool maintains clonal integrity by clearance of individual {HSCs} after stress to prevent propagation of damaged stem cells.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Numerous studies have used microarrays to identify gene signatures for predicting cancer patient clinical outcome and responses to chemotherapy. However, the potential impact of gene expression profiling in cancer diagnosis, prognosis and development of personalized treatment may not be fully exploited due to the lack of consensus gene signatures and poor understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. {METHODS}: We developed a novel approach to derive gene signatures for breast cancer prognosis in the context of known biological pathways. Using unsupervised methods, cancer patients were separated into distinct groups based on gene expression patterns in one of the following pathways: apoptosis, cell cycle, angiogenesis, metastasis, p53, {DNA} repair, and several receptor-mediated signaling pathways including chemokines, {EGF}, {FGF}, {HIF}, {MAP} kinase, {JAK} and {NF}-{kappaB}. The survival probabilities were then compared between the patient groups to determine if differential gene expression in a specific pathway is correlated with differential survival. {RESULTS}: Our results revealed expression of cell cycle genes is strongly predictive of breast cancer outcomes. We further confirmed this observation by building a cell cycle gene signature model using supervised methods. Validated in multiple independent datasets, the cell cycle gene signature is a more accurate predictor for breast cancer clinical outcome than the previously identified Amsterdam 70-gene signature that has been developed into a {FDA} approved clinical test {MammaPrint}. {CONCLUSION}: Taken together, the gene expression signature model we developed from well defined pathways is not only a consistently powerful prognosticator but also mechanistically linked to cancer biology. Our approach provides an alternative to the current methodology of identifying gene expression markers for cancer prognosis and drug responses using the whole genome gene expression data.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: More accurate prognostic assessment of patients with neuroblastoma is required to better inform the choice of risk-related therapy. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a gene-expression signature to improve outcome prediction. {METHODS}: 59 genes were selected using an innovative data-mining strategy, and were profiled in the largest neuroblastoma patient series (n=579) to date using real-time quantitative {PCR} starting from only 20 ng of {RNA}. A multigene-expression signature was built using 30 training samples, tested on 313 test samples, and subsequently validated in a blind study on an independent set of 236 tumours. {FINDINGS}: The signature has a performance, sensitivity, and specificity of 85.4\% (95\% {CI} 77.7-93.2), 84.4\% (66.5-94.1), and 86.5\% (81.1-90.6), respectively, to predict patient outcome. Multivariate analysis indicates that the signature is a significant independent predictor of overall survival and progression-free survival after controlling for currently used risk factors: patients with high molecular risk have a higher risk of death from disease and higher risk of relapse or progression than patients with low molecular risk (odds ratio 19.32 [95\% {CI} 6.50-57.43] and 3.96 [1.97-7.97] for overall survival and progression-free survival, respectively, both p{\textbackslash}textless0.0001). Patients at an increased risk of an adverse outcome can also be identified in the current treatment groups, showing the potential of this signature for improved clinical management. These results were confirmed in the validation study, in which the signature was also independently statistically significant in a model adjusted for {MYCN} status, age, International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage, ploidy, International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification grade of differentiation, and mitosis karyorrhexis index (odds ratios between 4.81 and 10.53 depending on the model for overall survival and 3.68 [95\% {CI} 2.01-6.71] for progression-free survival). {INTERPRETATION}: The 59-gene expression signature is an accurate predictor of outcome in patients with neuroblastoma. The signature is an independent risk predictor, identifying patients with an increased risk of poor outcome in the current clinical-risk groups. The method and signature is suitable for routine laboratory testing, and should be evaluated in prospective studies. {FUNDING}: The Belgian Foundation Against Cancer, the Children Cancer Fund Ghent, the Belgian Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, the Belgian Kid's Fund and the Fondation Nuovo-Soldati ({JV}), the Fund for Scientific Research Flanders ({KDP}, {JH}), the Fund for Scientific Research Flanders, the Institute for the Promotion of Innovation by Science and Technology in Flanders, Strategisch basisonderzoek, the Fondation Fournier Majoie pour l'Innovation, the Instituto Carlos {III}, the Italian Neuroblastoma Foundation, the European Community under the {FP}6, and the Belgian programme of Interuniversity Poles of Attraction.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Biological networks characterize the interactions of biomolecules at a systems-level. One important property of biological networks is the modular structure, in which nodes are densely connected with each other, but between which there are only sparse connections. In this report, we attempted to find the relationship between the network topology and formation of modular structure by comparing gene co-expression networks with random networks. The organization of gene functional modules was also investigated. {RESULTS}: We constructed a genome-wide Arabidopsis gene co-expression network ({AGCN}) by using 1094 microarrays. We then analyzed the topological properties of {AGCN} and partitioned the network into modules by using an efficient graph clustering algorithm. In the {AGCN}, 382 hub genes formed a clique, and they were densely connected only to a small subset of the network. At the module level, the network clustering results provide a systems-level understanding of the gene modules that coordinate multiple biological processes to carry out specific biological functions. For instance, the photosynthesis module in {AGCN} involves a very large number ({\textbackslash}textgreater 1000) of genes which participate in various biological processes including photosynthesis, electron transport, pigment metabolism, chloroplast organization and biogenesis, cofactor metabolism, protein biosynthesis, and vitamin metabolism. The cell cycle module orchestrated the coordinated expression of hundreds of genes involved in cell cycle, {DNA} metabolism, and cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis. We also compared the {AGCN} constructed in this study with a graphical Gaussian model ({GGM}) based Arabidopsis gene network. The photosynthesis, protein biosynthesis, and cell cycle modules identified from the {GGM} network had much smaller module sizes compared with the modules found in the {AGCN}, respectively. {CONCLUSION}: This study reveals new insight into the topological properties of biological networks. The preferential hub-hub connections might be necessary for the formation of modular structure in gene co-expression networks. The study also reveals new insight into the organization of gene functional modules.},

	abstract = {To address the role of N-myc in neurogenesis and in nervous system tumors, it was conditionally disrupted in neuronal progenitor cells ({NPCs}) with a nestin-Cre transgene. Null mice display ataxia, behavioral abnormalities, and tremors that correlate with a twofold decrease in brain mass that disproportionately affects the cerebellum (sixfold reduced in mass) and the cerebral cortex, both of which show signs of disorganization. In control mice at E12.5, we observe a domain of high N-Myc protein expression in the rapidly proliferating cerebellar primordium. Targeted deletion of N-myc results in severely compromised proliferation as shown by a striking decrease in S phase and mitotic cells as well as in cells expressing the Myc target gene cyclin D2, whereas apoptosis is unaffected. Null progenitor cells also have comparatively high levels of the cdk inhibitors p27(Kip1) and p18(Ink4c), whereas p15(Ink4b), p21(Cip1), and p19(Ink4d) levels are unaffected. Many null progenitors also exhibit altered nuclear morphology and size. In addition, loss of N-myc disrupts neuronal differentiation as evidenced by ectopic staining of the neuron specific marker {betaTUBIII} in the cerebrum. Furthermore, in progenitor cell cultures derived from null embryonic brain, we observe a dramatic increase in neuronal differentiation compared with controls. Thus, N-myc is essential for normal neurogenesis, regulating {NPC} proliferation, differentiation, and nuclear size. Its effects on proliferation and differentiation appear due, at least in part, to down-regulation of a specific subset of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors.},

Elucidating network properties that distinguish disease from the healthy cellular state is therefore of critical importance for gaining systems-level insights into disease mechanisms and ultimately for developing improved therapies. By integrating gene expression data with a protein interaction network we here demonstrate that cancer cells are characterised by an increase in network entropy. In addition, we formally demonstrate that gene expression differences between normal and cancer tissue are anticorrelated with local network entropy changes, thus providing a systemic link between gene expression changes at the nodes and their local correlation patterns. In particular, we find that genes which drive cell-proliferation in cancer cells and which often encode oncogenes are associated with reductions in network entropy. These findings may have potential implications for identifying novel drug targets.},

These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, {MutSigCV}, for resolving the problem. We apply {MutSigCV} to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with {DNA} replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, {MutSigCV} is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.},

Although more than 70 trajectory inference tools have already been developed, it is challenging to compare their performance because the input they require and output models they produce vary substantially. Here, we benchmark 45 of these methods on 110 real and 229 synthetic datasets for cellular ordering, topology, scalability and usability. Our results highlight the complementarity of existing tools, and that the choice of method should depend mostly on the dataset dimensions and trajectory topology. Based on these results, we develop a set of guidelines to help users select the best method for their dataset. Our freely available data and evaluation pipeline ( https://benchmark.dynverse.org ) will aid in the development of improved tools designed to analyze increasingly large and complex single-cell datasets.},

	abstract = {Graphlet frequency distribution ({GFD}) has recently become popular for characterizing large networks. However, the computation of {GFD} for a network requires the exact count of embedded graphlets in that network, which is a computationally expensive task. As a result, it is practically infeasible to compute the {GFD} for even a moderately large network. In this paper, we propose {GUISE}, which uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) sampling method for constructing the approximate {GFD} of a large network. Our experiments on networks with millions of nodes show that {GUISE} obtains the {GFD} within few minutes, whereas the exhaustive counting based approach takes several days.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Algorithmic and modeling advances in the area of protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) network analysis could contribute to the understanding of biological processes. Local structure of networks can be measured by the frequency distribution of graphlets, small connected non-isomorphic induced subgraphs. This measure of local structure has been used to show that high-confidence {PPI} networks have local structure of geometric random graphs. Finding graphlets exhaustively in a large network is computationally intensive. More complete {PPI} networks, as well as {PPI} networks of higher organisms, will thus require efficient heuristic approaches. {RESULTS}: We propose two efficient and scalable heuristics for finding graphlets in high-confidence {PPI} networks. We show that both {PPI} and their model geometric random networks, have defined boundaries that are sparser than the 'inner parts' of the networks. In addition, these networks exhibit 'uniformity' of local structure inside the networks. Our first heuristic exploits these two structural properties of {PPI} and geometric random networks to find good estimates of graphlet frequency distributions in these networks up to 690 times faster than the exhaustive searches. Our second heuristic is a variant of a more standard sampling technique and it produces accurate approximate results up to 377 times faster than the exhaustive searches. We indicate how the combination of these approaches may result in an even better heuristic. {AVAILABILITY}: Supplementary information is available at http://www.cs.toronto.edu/∼natasha/{BIOINF}-2005-0946/Supplementary.pdf.

At some loci, this efficacy approaches 100\%, including biallelic conversion in somatic tissues that mimics phenotypes seen using morpholino-based targeted gene knockdowns. With this updated {TALEN} system, we successfully used single-stranded {DNA} oligonucleotides to precisely modify sequences at predefined locations in the zebrafish genome through homology-directed repair, including the introduction of a custom-designed {EcoRV} site and a modified {loxP} ({mloxP}) sequence into somatic tissue in vivo.

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: In recent years, there have been various efforts to overcome the limitations of standard clustering approaches for the analysis of gene expression data by grouping genes and samples simultaneously. The underlying concept, which is often referred to as biclustering, allows to identify sets of genes sharing compatible expression patterns across subsets of samples, and its usefulness has been demonstrated for different organisms and datasets. Several biclustering methods have been proposed in the literature; however, it is not clear how the different techniques compare with each other with respect to the biological relevance of the clusters as well as with other characteristics such as robustness and sensitivity to noise. Accordingly, no guidelines concerning the choice of the biclustering method are currently available. {RESULTS}: First, this paper provides a methodology for comparing and validating biclustering methods that includes a simple binary reference model. Although this model captures the essential features of most biclustering approaches, it is still simple enough to exactly determine all optimal groupings; to this end, we propose a fast divide-and-conquer algorithm (Bimax). Second, we evaluate the performance of five salient biclustering algorithms together with the reference model and a hierarchical clustering method on various synthetic and real datasets for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana. The comparison reveals that (1) biclustering in general has advantages over a conventional hierarchical clustering approach, (2) there are considerable performance differences between the tested methods and (3) already the simple reference model delivers relevant patterns within all considered settings.},

In an effort to develop model systems that are able to generate surrogates of human pathologies, a powerful suite of tools have been developed in zebrafish, taking advantage of the relatively small (compared to invertebrate models) evolutionary distance of that genome to humans, the orthology of several organs and signaling processes, and the suitability of this organism for medium and high throughput phenotypic screening. Here we will review the use of this model organism in dissecting human genetic disorders; we will highlight how diverse strategies have informed disease causality and genetic architecture; and we will discuss relative strengths and limitations of these approaches in the context of medical genome sequencing.

Network motifs were demonstrated to play key information processing roles in biological regulation networks. Existing algorithms for detecting network motifs act by exhaustively enumerating all subgraphs with a given number of nodes in the network. The runtime of such algorithms increases strongly with network size. Here, we present a novel algorithm that allows estimation of subgraph concentrations and detection of network motifs at a runtime that is asymptotically independent of the network size. This algorithm is based on random sampling of subgraphs. Network motifs are detected with a surprisingly small number of samples in a wide variety of networks. Our method can be applied to estimate the concentrations of larger subgraphs in larger networks than was previously possible with exhaustive enumeration algorithms. We present results for high-order motifs in several biological networks and discuss their possible functions. {AVAILABILITY}: A software tool for estimating subgraph concentrations and detecting network motifs (mfinder 1.1) and further information is available at http://www.weizmann.ac.il/mcb/{UriAlon}/},

	abstract = {One of the long-standing open challenges in computational systems biology is the topology inference of gene regulatory networks from high-throughput omics data. Recently, two community-wide efforts, {DREAM}4 and {DREAM}5, have been established to benchmark network inference techniques using gene expression measurements. In these challenges the overall top performer was the {GENIE}3 algorithm. This method decomposes the network inference task into separate regression problems for each gene in the network in which the expression values of a particular target gene are predicted using all other genes as possible predictors. Next, using tree-based ensemble methods, an importance measure for each predictor gene is calculated with respect to the target gene and a high feature importance is considered as putative evidence of a regulatory link existing between both genes. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we generalize the regression decomposition strategy of {GENIE}3 to other feature importance methods. We compare the performance of support vector regression, the elastic net, random forest regression, symbolic regression and their ensemble variants in this setting to the original {GENIE}3 algorithm. To create the ensemble variants, we propose a subsampling approach which allows us to cast any feature selection algorithm that produces a feature ranking into an ensemble feature importance algorithm. We demonstrate that the ensemble setting is key to the network inference task, as only ensemble variants achieve top performance. As second contribution, we explore the effect of using rankwise averaged predictions of multiple ensemble algorithms as opposed to only one. We name this approach {NIMEFI} (Network Inference using Multiple Ensemble Feature Importance algorithms) and show that this approach outperforms all individual methods in general, although on a specific network a single method can perform better. An implementation of {NIMEFI} has been made publicly available.},

	abstract = {In 1983, the {MYCN} oncogene amplification was discovered in neuroblastoma cells and few years later its prognostic role was clearly demonstrated. The first European study, in which {MYCN} gene status is taken as prognostic factor for therapeutic decision, was released by {SIOPEN} and {GPOH} in 1995. Afterward, other trials were released by {SIOPEN}, {GPOH}, {COG}, and {JNBSG} in which {MYCN} gene amplification was employed as prognostic risk factor. However, since {MYCN} is abnormal in about 20\% of tumors and is a reliable prognostic marker for only some subgroups of patients, additional chromosomal abnormalities have been introduced for clinical decisions: 1p deletions/imbalances ({GPOH}), 11q deletions/imbalances ({COG}), and structural copy number aberrations ({SIOPEN}). {MYCN} gene status and chromosome aberrations improved patients' risk evaluation and helped to develop tailored therapy for diverse subgroups of patients. Unfortunately, high risk patients still have an unfavorable prognosis and are the major challenge for oncologists. In the last decade, the advent of genome-wide analysis and the next generation sequencing technique have given the opportunity to deeply investigate the genome of neuroblastoma to identify both candidate genes associated with tumor progression and druggable target genes. {ALK} gene is an actual candidate for the therapy with small molecule inhibitors, but others as {mTOR}, Aurora, and {TRK}, are suitable targets for subgroups of high risk patients. The huge amount of clinical and biological information collected in the last 20 years suggests that it is time to turn on for new and more personalized therapies of neuroblastoma.},

	volume = {22},
	abstract = {Waddington's epigenetic landscape is probably the most famous and most powerful metaphor in developmental biology. Cells, represented by balls, roll downhill through a landscape of bifurcating valleys. Each new valley represents a possible cell fate and the ridges between the valleys maintain the cell fate once it has been chosen. Here I examine models of two important developmental processes - cell-fate induction and lateral inhibition - and ask whether the landscapes for these models at least qualitatively resemble Waddington's picture. For cell-fate induction, the answer is no. The commitment of a cell to a new fate corresponds to the disappearance of a valley from the landscape, not the splitting of one valley into two, and it occurs through a type of bifurcation - a saddle-node bifurcation - that possesses an intrinsic irreversibility that is missing from Waddington's picture. Lateral inhibition, a symmetrical cell-cell competition process, corresponds better to Waddington's picture, with one valley reversibly splitting into two through a pitchfork bifurcation. I propose an alternative epigenetic landscape that has numerous valleys and ridges right from the start, with the process of cell-fate commitment corresponding to the irreversible disappearance of some of these valleys and ridges, via cell-fate induction, complemented by the creation of new valleys and ridges through processes like cell-cell competition.},

Here, we use single-cell lineage tracing to demonstrate that so-called {CMPs} are highly heterogeneous with respect to cellular output, with most individual {CMPs} yielding either only erythrocytes or only myeloid cells after transplantation. Furthermore, based on the labeling of earlier progenitors, we show that the divergence between the myeloid and erythroid lineage develops within multipotent progenitors ({MPP}). These data provide evidence for a model of hematopoietic branching in which multiple distinct lineage commitments occur in parallel within the {MPP} pool.},

In this study we demonstrate for a variety of simulated and biological gene expression data from S. cerevisiae that {BC}3NET is an important enhancement over other inference methods that is capable of capturing biochemical interactions from transcription regulation and protein-protein interaction sensibly.

	abstract = {The need to analyze high-dimension biological data is driving the development of new data mining methods. Biclustering algorithms have been successfully applied to gene expression data to discover local patterns, in which a subset of genes exhibit similar expression levels over a subset of conditions. However, it is not clear which algorithms are best suited for this task. Many algorithms have been published in the past decade, most of which have been compared only to a small number of algorithms. Surveys and comparisons exist in the literature, but because of the large number and variety of biclustering algorithms, they are quickly outdated. In this article we partially address this problem of evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of existing biclustering methods. We used the {BiBench} package to compare 12 algorithms, many of which were recently published or have not been extensively studied. The algorithms were tested on a suite of synthetic data sets to measure their performance on data with varying conditions, such as different bicluster models, varying noise, varying numbers of biclusters and overlapping biclusters. The algorithms were also tested on eight large gene expression data sets obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was performed on the resulting biclusters, and the best enrichment terms are reported. Our analyses show that the biclustering method and its parameters should be selected based on the desired model, whether that model allows overlapping biclusters, and its robustness to noise. In addition, we observe that the biclustering algorithms capable of finding more than one model are more successful at capturing biologically relevant clusters.},

The virtually transparent embryos of this species, and the ability to accelerate genetic studies by gene knockdown or overexpression, have led to the widespread use of zebrafish in the detailed investigation of vertebrate gene function and increasingly, the study of human genetic disease. However, for effective modelling of human genetic disease it is important to understand the extent to which zebrafish genes and gene structures are related to orthologous human genes. To examine this, we generated a high-quality sequence assembly of the zebrafish genome, made up of an overlapping set of completely sequenced large-insert clones that were ordered and oriented using a high-resolution high-density meiotic map. Detailed automatic and manual annotation provides evidence of more than 26,000 protein-coding genes, the largest gene set of any vertebrate so far sequenced. Comparison to the human reference genome shows that approximately 70\% of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue. In addition, the high quality of this genome assembly provides a clearer understanding of key genomic features such as a unique repeat content, a scarcity of pseudogenes, an enrichment of zebrafish-specific genes on chromosome 4 and chromosomal regions that influence sex determination.},

	abstract = {Recognizing aerial image categories is useful for scene annotation and surveillance. Local features have been demonstrated to be robust to image transformations, including occlusions and clutters. However, the geometric property of an aerial image (i.e., the topology and relative displacement of local features), which is key to discriminating aerial image categories, cannot be effectively represented by state-of-the-art generic visual descriptors. To solve this problem, we propose a recognition model that mines graphlets from aerial images, where graphlets are small connected subgraphs reflecting both the geometric property and color/texture distribution of an aerial image. More specifically, each aerial image is decomposed into a set of basic components (e.g., road and playground) and a region adjacency graph ({RAG}) is accordingly constructed to model their spatial interactions. Aerial image categories recognition can subsequently be casted as {RAG}-to-{RAG} matching. Based on graph theory, {RAG}-to-{RAG} matching is conducted by comparing all their respective graphlets. Because the number of graphlets is huge, we derive a manifold embedding algorithm to measure different-sized graphlets, after which we select graphlets that have highly discriminative and low redundancy topologies. Through quantizing the selected graphlets from each aerial image into a feature vector, we use support vector machine to discriminate aerial image categories. Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art object/scene recognition models, and the visualized graphlets indicate that the discriminative patterns are discovered by our proposed approach.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: With the advent of systems biology, biological knowledge is often represented today by networks. These include regulatory and metabolic networks, protein-protein interaction networks, and many others. At the same time, high-throughput genomics and proteomics techniques generate very large data sets, which require sophisticated computational analysis. Usually, separate and different analysis methodologies are applied to each of the two data types. An integrated investigation of network and high-throughput information together can improve the quality of the analysis by accounting simultaneously for topological network properties alongside intrinsic features of the high-throughput data. {RESULTS}: We describe a novel algorithmic framework for this challenge. We first transform the high-throughput data into similarity values, (e.g., by computing pairwise similarity of gene expression patterns from microarray data). Then, given a network of genes or proteins and similarity values between some of them, we seek connected sub-networks (or modules) that manifest high similarity. We develop algorithms for this problem and evaluate their performance on the osmotic shock response network in S. cerevisiae and on the human cell cycle network. We demonstrate that focused, biologically meaningful and relevant functional modules are obtained. In comparison with extant algorithms, our approach has higher sensitivity and higher specificity. {CONCLUSION}: We have demonstrated that our method can accurately identify functional modules. Hence, it carries the promise to be highly useful in analysis of high throughput data.},

Immunohistochemistry for subgroup-specific signature genes was used to determine subgroup affiliation for 294 nonoverlapping medulloblastomas on two independent tissue microarrays. {RESULTS}: Multiple unsupervised analyses of transcriptional profiles identified the following four distinct, nonoverlapping molecular variants: {WNT}, {SHH}, group C, and group D. Supervised analysis of these four subgroups revealed significant subgroup-specific demographics, histology, metastatic status, and {DNA} copy number aberrations. Immunohistochemistry for {DKK}1 ({WNT}), {SFRP}1 ({SHH}), {NPR}3 (group C), and {KCNA}1 (group D) could reliably and uniquely classify formalin-fixed medulloblastomas in approximately 98\% of patients. Group C patients ({NPR}3-positive tumors) exhibited a significantly diminished progression-free and overall survival irrespective of their metastatic status. {CONCLUSION}: Our integrative genomics approach to a large cohort of medulloblastomas has identified four disparate subgroups with distinct demographics, clinical presentation, transcriptional profiles, genetic abnormalities, and clinical outcome. Medulloblastomas can be reliably assigned to subgroups through immunohistochemistry, thereby making medulloblastoma subclassification widely available. Future research on medulloblastoma and the development of clinical trials should take into consideration these four distinct types of medulloblastoma.},

Ddit3 emerges as a regulatory node with positive linkage to erythroid regulators and negative association with myeloid determinants. Ddit3 loss impairs erythroid colony output from multipotent cells, while forcing Ddit3 in granulo-monocytic progenitors ({GMPs}) enhances self-renewal and impedes differentiation. Network analysis of Ddit3-transduced {GMPs} reveals uncoupling of myeloid networks and strengthening of erythroid linkages. {RNA} sequencing suggests that Ddit3 acts through development or stabilization of a precursor upstream of {GMPs} with inherent Meg-E potential. The enrichment of Gata2 target genes in Ddit3-dependent transcriptional responses suggests that Ddit3 functions in an erythroid transcriptional network nucleated by Gata2.},

	url = {http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/24/120378.full.pdf+html},
	doi = {10.1101/120378},
	abstract = {In recent years, dimensionality reduction methods have become critical for visualization, exploration, and interpretation of high-throughput, high-dimensional biological data, as they enable the extraction of major trends in the data while discarding noise. However, biological data contains a type of predominant structure that is not preserved in commonly used methods such as {PCA} and {tSNE}, namely, branching progression structure. This structure, which is often non-linear, arises from underlying biological processes such as differentiation, graded responses to stimuli, and population drift, which generate cellular (or population) diversity. We propose a novel, affinity-preserving embedding called {PHATE} (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Trajectory Embedding), designed explicitly to preserve progression structure in data. {PHATE} provides a denoised, two or three-dimensional visualization of the complete branching trajectory structure in high-dimensional data. It uses heat-diffusion processes, which naturally denoise the data, to compute cell-cell affinities. Then, {PHATE} creates a diffusion-potential geometry by free-energy potentials of these processes. This geometry captures high-dimensional trajectory structures, while enabling a natural embedding of the intrinsic data geometry. This embedding accurately visualizes trajectories and data distances, without requiring strict assumptions typically used by path-finding and tree-fitting algorithms, which have recently been used for pseudotime orderings or tree-renderings of cellular data. Furthermore, {PHATE} supports a wide range of data exploration tasks by providing interpretable overlays on top of the visualization. We show that such overlays can emphasize and reveal trajectory end-points, branch points and associated split-decisions, progression-forming variables (e.g., specific genes), and paths between developmental events in cellular state-space. We demonstrate {PHATE} on single-cell {RNA} sequencing and mass cytometry data pertaining to embryoid body differentiation, {IPSC} reprogramming, and hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. We also demonstrate {PHATE} on non-single cell data including single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) measurements of European populations, and 16s sequencing of gut microbiota.},

In the case of experimentally verified human {TF}-{TG} interactions, there is no database at present that explicitly provides such information even though many databases containing human {TF}-{TG} interaction data have been available. In an effort to provide researchers with a repository of experimentally verified human {TF}-{TG} interactions from which such interactions can be directly extracted, we present here the Human Transcriptional Regulation Interactions database ({HTRIdb}). {DESCRIPTION}: The {HTRIdb} is an open-access database that can be searched via a user-friendly web interface and the retrieved {TF}-{TG} interactions data and the associated protein-protein interactions can be downloaded or interactively visualized as a network through the web version of the popular Cytoscape visualization tool, the Cytoscape Web. Moreover, users can improve the database quality by uploading their own interactions and indicating inconsistencies in the data. So far, {HTRIdb} has been populated with 284 {TFs} that regulate 18302 genes, totaling 51871 {TF}-{TG} interactions. {HTRIdb} is freely available at http://www.lbbc.ibb.unesp.br/htri. {CONCLUSIONS}: {HTRIdb} is a powerful user-friendly tool from which human experimentally validated {TF}-{TG} interactions can be easily extracted and used to construct transcriptional regulation interaction networks enabling researchers to decipher the regulation of biological processes.},

Characterizing the transcripts, both annotated and novel, that are expressed in a given tissue has become vital for understanding the mechanisms underlying the pathology of disease. {RESULTS}: We sequenced {RNA} prepared from three normal human retinas and characterized the retinal transcriptome at an unprecedented level due to the increased depth of sampling provided by the {RNA}-seq approach. We used a non-redundant reference transcriptome from all of the empirically-determined human reference tracks to identify annotated and novel sequences expressed in the retina. We detected 79,915 novel alternative splicing events, including 29,887 novel exons, 21,757 3' and 5' alternate splice sites, and 28,271 exon skipping events. We also identified 116 potential novel genes. These data represent a significant addition to the annotated human transcriptome. For example, the novel exons detected increase the number of identified exons by 3\%. Using a high-throughput {RNA} capture approach to validate 14,696 of these novel transcriptome features we found that 99\% of the putative novel events can be reproducibly detected. Further, 15-36\% of the novel splicing events maintain an open reading frame, suggesting they produce novel protein products. {CONCLUSIONS}: To our knowledge, this is the first application of {RNA} capture to perform large-scale validation of novel transcriptome features. In total, these analyses provide extensive detail about a previously uncharacterized level of transcript diversity in the human retina.},

First, we infer a gene regulatory network from a large-scale B-cell lymphoma expression data set using the C3NET algorithm. Second, we provide a functional and structural analysis of the largest connected component of this network, revealing that this network component corresponds to the peripheral region of a cell. Third, we analyze the hierarchical organization of network components of the whole inferred B-cell gene regulatory network by introducing a new approach which exploits the variability within the data as well as the inferential characteristics of C3NET. As a result, we find a functional bisection of the network corresponding to different cellular components.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\${nCONCLUSIONS}: Overall, our study allows to highlight the peripheral gene regulatory network of B-cells and shows that it is centered around hub transmembrane proteins located at the physical periphery of the cell.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: It has been long well known that genes do not act alone; rather groups of genes act in consort during a biological process. Consequently, the expression levels of genes are dependent on each other. Experimental techniques to detect such interacting pairs of genes have been in place for quite some time. With the advent of microarray technology, newer computational techniques to detect such interaction or association between gene expressions are being proposed which lead to an association network. While most microarray analyses look for genes that are differentially expressed, it is of potentially greater significance to identify how entire association network structures change between two or more biological settings, say normal versus diseased cell types. {RESULTS}: We provide a recipe for conducting a differential analysis of networks constructed from microarray data under two experimental settings. At the core of our approach lies a connectivity score that represents the strength of genetic association or interaction between two genes. We use this score to propose formal statistical tests for each of following queries: (i) whether the overall modular structures of the two networks are different, (ii) whether the connectivity of a particular set of "interesting genes" has changed between the two networks, and (iii) whether the connectivity of a given single gene has changed between the two networks. A number of examples of this score is provided. We carried out our method on two types of simulated data: Gaussian networks and networks based on differential equations. We show that, for appropriate choices of the connectivity scores and tuning parameters, our method works well on simulated data. We also analyze a real data set involving normal versus heavy mice and identify an interesting set of genes that may play key roles in obesity. {CONCLUSIONS}: Examining changes in network structure can provide valuable information about the underlying biochemical pathways. Differential network analysis with appropriate connectivity scores is a useful tool in exploring changes in network structures under different biological conditions.

Gene coexpression network analysis lends itself to identification of entire groups of differentially regulated genes-a highly relevant endeavor in finding the underpinnings of complex traits that are, by definition, polygenic in nature. Here we describe one such approach based on liver gene expression and genotype data from an F(2) mouse inter-cross utilizing weighted gene coexpression network analysis ({WGCNA}) of gene expression data to identify physiologically relevant modules. We describe two strategies: single-network analysis and differential network analysis. Single-network analysis reveals the presence of a physiologically interesting module that can be found in two distinct mouse crosses. Module quantitative trait loci ({mQTLs}) that perturb this module were discovered. In addition, we report a list of genetic drivers for this module. Differential network analysis reveals differences in connectivity and module structure between two networks based on the liver expression data of lean and obese mice. Functional annotation of these genes suggests a biological pathway involving epidermal growth factor ({EGF}). Our results demonstrate the utility of {WGCNA} in identifying genetic drivers and in finding genetic pathways represented by gene modules. These examples provide evidence that integration of network properties may well help chart the path across the gene-trait chasm.},

	abstract = {{MYCN} amplification occurs in approximately 20\% of human neuroblastomas and is associated with early tumor progression and poor outcome, despite intensive multimodal treatment. However, {MYCN} overexpression also sensitizes neuroblastoma cells to apoptosis. Thus, uncovering the molecular mechanisms linking {MYCN} to apoptosis might contribute to designing more efficient therapies for {MYCN}-amplified tumors. Here we show that {MYCN}-dependent sensitization to apoptosis requires activation of p53 and its phosphorylation at serine 46. The p53(S46) kinase {HIPK}2 accumulates on {MYCN} expression, and its depletion by {RNA} interference impairs p53(S46) phosphorylation and apoptosis. Remarkably, {MYCN} induces a {DNA} damage response that accounts for the inhibition of {HIPK}2 degradation through an {ATM}- and {NBS}1-dependent pathway. Prompted by the rare occurrence of p53 mutations and by the broad expression of {HIPK}2 in our human neuroblastoma series, we evaluated the effects of the p53-reactivating compound Nutlin-3 on this pathway. At variance from other tumor histotypes, in {MYCN}-amplified neuroblastoma, Nutlin-3 further induced {HIPK}2 accumulation, p53(S46) phosphorylation, and apoptosis, and in combination with clastogenic agents purged virtually the entire cell population. Altogether, our data uncover a novel mechanism linking {MYCN} to apoptosis that can be triggered by the p53-reactivating compound Nutlin-3, supporting its use in the most difficult-to-treat subset of neuroblastoma.},

	abstract = {Biological networks, such as those describing gene regulation, signal transduction, and neural synapses, are representations of large-scale dynamic systems. Discovery of organizing principles of biological networks can be enhanced by embracing the notion that there is a deep interplay between network structure and system dynamics. Recently, many structural characteristics of these non-random networks have been identified, but dynamical implications of the features have not been explored comprehensively. We demonstrate by exhaustive computational analysis that a dynamical property–stability or robustness to small perturbations–is highly correlated with the relative abundance of small subnetworks (network motifs) in several previously determined biological networks. We propose that robust dynamical stability is an influential property that can determine the non-random structure of biological networks.},

One of the major challenges of systems biology today is to devise generally applicable methods of interpreting this data in a way that will shed light on the complex relationships between multiple genes and their products. The importance of such information is clear, not only as an aid to areas of research like drug design, but also as a contribution to our understanding of the mechanisms behind an organism's ability to react to its environment. {RESULTS}: We detail one computational approach for using gene expression data to identify response networks in an organism. The method is based on the construction of biological networks given different sets of interaction information and the reduction of the said networks to important response sub-networks via the integration of the gene expression data. As an application, the expression data of known stress responders and {DNA} repair genes in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is used to construct a generic stress response sub-network. This is compared to similar networks constructed from data obtained from subjecting M.tuberculosis to various drugs; we are thus able to distinguish between generic stress response and specific drug response. We anticipate that this approach will be able to accelerate target identification and drug development for tuberculosis in the future. {CONTACT}: chris@lanl.gov {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary Figures 1 through 6 on drug response networks and differential network analyses on cerulenin, chlorpromazine, ethionamide, ofloxacin, thiolactomycin and triclosan.

Instead, unilineage-restricted cells emerge directly from a `continuum of low-primed undifferentiated haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells' ({CLOUD}-{HSPCs}). Distinct gene expression modules operate in a combinatorial manner to control stemness, early lineage priming and the subsequent progression into all major branches of haematopoiesis.

See et al. applied single-cell {RNA} sequencing and cytometry by time-of-flight to characterize the developmental pathways of these cells. They identified blood {DC} precursors that shared surface markers with plasmacytoid {DCs} but that were functionally distinct. This unsuspected level of complexity in pre-{DC} populations reveals additional cell types and refines understanding of known cell types. Science, this issue p. eaag3009 Structured Abstract {INTRODUCTIONDendritic} cells ({DC}) are professional antigen-presenting cells that orchestrate immune responses. The human {DC} population comprises multiple subsets, including plasmacytoid {DC} ({pDC}) and two functionally specialized lineages of conventional {DC} ({cDC}1 and {cDC}2), whose origins and differentiation pathways remain incompletely defined. {RATIONALEAs} {DC} are essential regulators of the immune response in health and disease, potential intervention strategies aiming at manipulation of these cells will require in-depth insights of their origins, the mechanisms that govern their homeostasis, and their functional properties. Here, we employed two unbiased high-dimensional technologies to characterize the human {DC} lineage from bone marrow to blood. {RESULTSWe} isolated the {DC}-containing population (Lineage-{HLA}-{DR}+{CD}135+ cells) from human blood and defined the transcriptomes of 710 individual cells using massively parallel single-cell {mRNA} sequencing. By combining complementary bioinformatic approaches, we identified a small cluster of cells within this population as putative {DC} precursors (pre-{DC}). We then confirmed this finding using cytometry by time-of-flight ({CyTOF}) to simultaneously measure the expression of a panel of 38 different proteins at the single-cell level on Lineage-{HLA}-{DR}+ cells and found that pre-{DC} possessed a {CD}123+{CD}33+{CD}45RA+ phenotype. We confirmed the precursor potential of pre-{DC} by establishing their potential to differentiate in vitro into {cDC}1 and {cDC}2, but not {pDC}, in the known proportions found in vivo.Interestingly, pre-{DC} also express classical {pDC} markers, including {CD}123, {CD}303, and {CD}304. Thus, any previous studies using these markers to identify or isolate {pDC} will have inadvertently included {CD}123+{CD}33+ pre-{DC}. We provide here new markers that can be used to identify unambiguously pre-{DC} from {pDC}, including {CD}33, {CX}3CR1, {CD}2, {CD}5, and {CD}327. When {CD}123+{CD}33+ pre-{DC} and {CD}123+{CD}33- {pDC} were isolated separately, we observed that pre-{DC} have unique functional properties that were previously attributed to {pDC}. Although {pDC} remain bona fide interferon-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$\${\textbackslash}backslash\$textendash\{\}producing cells, their reported interleukin-12 ({IL}-12) production and {CD}4 T cell allostimulatory capacity can likely be attributed to “contaminating” pre-{DC}.We then asked whether the pre-{DC} population contained both uncommitted and committed pre-{cDC}1 and pre-{cDC}2 precursors, as recently shown in mice. Using microfluidic single-cell {mRNA} sequencing ({scmRNAseq}), we showed that the human pre-{DC} population contains cells exhibiting transcriptomic priming toward {cDC}1 and {cDC}2 lineages. Flow cytometry and in vitro {DC} differentiation experiments further identified {CD}123+{CADM}1-{CD}1c- putative uncommitted pre-{DC}, alongside {CADM}1+{CD}1c- pre-{cDC}1 and {CADM}1-{CD}1c+ pre-{cDC}2. Finally, we found that pre-{DC} subsets expressed T cell costimulatory molecules and induced comparable proliferation and polarization of naïve {CD}4 T cells as adult {DC}. However, exposure to the Toll-like receptor 9 ({TLR}9) ligand {CpG} triggered {IL}-12p40 and tumor necrosis factor\${\textbackslash}backslash\$textendash\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ production by early pre-{DC}, pre-{cDC}1, and pre-{cDC}2, in contrast to differentiated {cDC}1 and {cDC}2, which do not express {TLR}9. {CONCLUSIONUsing} unsupervised {scmRNAseq} and {CyTOF} analyses, we have unraveled the complexity of the human {DC} lineage at the single-cell level, revealing a continuous process of differentiation that starts in the bone marrow ({BM}) with common {DC} progenitors ({CDP}), diverges at the point of emergence of pre-{DC} and {pDC} potential, and culminates in maturation of both lineages in the blood and spleen. The pre-{DC} compartment contains functionally and phenotypically distinct lineage-committed subpopulations, including one early uncommitted {CD}123+ pre-{DC} subset and two {CD}45RA+{CD}123lo lineage-committed subsets. The discovery of multiple committed pre-{DC} populations with unique capabilities opens promising new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of {DC} subset-specific targeting. \${\textbackslash}textless\$img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/356/6342/eaag3009/F1.medium.gif"/\${\textbackslash}textgreater\$ Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Human {DC} emerge from {BM} {CDP}, diverge at the point of emergence of pre-{DC} and {pDC} potential, and culminate in maturation of both lineages in the blood.The pre-{DC} compartment further differentiates into functionally and phenotypically distinct lineage-committed subpopulations, including one early uncommitted {CD}123+ pre-{DC} subset (early pre-{DC}), which give rise to both {cDC}1 and {cDC}2 through corresponding {CD}45RA+{CD}123lo pre-{cDC}1 and pre-{cDC}2 lineage-committed subsets, respectively.

	volume = {16},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gene expression is an inherently stochastic process, owing to its dynamic molecular nature. Protein amount distributions, which can be acquired by cytometry using a reporter gene, can inform about the mechanisms of the underlying microscopic molecular system. {RESULTS}: By using different clones of chicken erythroid progenitor cells harboring different integration sites of a {CMV}-driven {mCherry} protein, we investigated the dynamical behavior of such distributions. We show that, on short term, clone distributions can be quickly regenerated from small population samples with a high accuracy. On longer term, on the contrary, we show variations manifested by correlated fluctuation in the Mean Fluorescence Intensity. In search for a possible cause of this correlation, we demonstrate that in response to small temperature variations cells are able to adjust their gene expression rate: a modest (2 °C) increase in external temperature induces a significant down regulation of mean expression values, with a reverse effect observed when the temperature is decreased. Using a two-state model of gene expression we further demonstrate that temperature acts by modifying the size of transcription bursts, while the burst frequency of the investigated promoter is less systematically affected. {CONCLUSIONS}: For the first time, we report that transcription burst size is a key parameter for gene expression that metazoan cells from homeotherm animals can modify in response to an external thermal stimulus.},

We used single cell {RNA}-seq to dissect variability in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell populations from young and old mice from two strains. We found that cell cycle dominates the variability within each population, and that there is a lower frequency of cells in the G1 phase among old compared to young long-term hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting that they traverse through G1 faster. Moreover, transcriptional changes in {HSCs} during aging are inversely related to those upon {HSC} differentiation, such that old short term ({ST})-{HSCs} resemble young long-term ({LT}-{HSCs}), suggesting that they exist in a less differentiated state. Our results indicate both compositional changes and intrinsic, population-wide changes with age and are consistent with a model where a relationship between cell-cycle progression and self-renewal versus differentiation of {HSCs} is affected by aging and may contribute to the functional decline of old {HSCs}.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gene-expression analysis is increasingly important in biological research, with real-time reverse transcription {PCR} ({RT}-{PCR}) becoming the method of choice for high-throughput and accurate expression profiling of selected genes. Given the increased sensitivity, reproducibility and large dynamic range of this methodology, the requirements for a proper internal control gene for normalization have become increasingly stringent. Although housekeeping gene expression has been reported to vary considerably, no systematic survey has properly determined the errors related to the common practice of using only one control gene, nor presented an adequate way of working around this problem. {RESULTS}: We outline a robust and innovative strategy to identify the most stably expressed control genes in a given set of tissues, and to determine the minimum number of genes required to calculate a reliable normalization factor. We have evaluated ten housekeeping genes from different abundance and functional classes in various human tissues, and demonstrated that the conventional use of a single gene for normalization leads to relatively large errors in a significant proportion of samples tested. The geometric mean of multiple carefully selected housekeeping genes was validated as an accurate normalization factor by analyzing publicly available microarray data. {CONCLUSIONS}: The normalization strategy presented here is a prerequisite for accurate {RT}-{PCR} expression profiling, which, among other things, opens up the possibility of studying the biological relevance of small expression differences.},

Here, the Immunological Genome Project gene-expression profiles across mouse immune lineages allowed us to systematically analyze these circuits. To analyze this data set we developed Ontogenet, an algorithm for reconstructing lineage-specific regulation from gene-expression profiles across lineages. Using Ontogenet, we found differentiation stage-specific regulators of mouse hematopoiesis and identified many known hematopoietic regulators and 175 previously unknown candidate regulators, as well as their target genes and the cell types in which they act. Among the previously unknown regulators, we emphasize the role of {ETV}5 in the differentiation of \${\textbackslash}gamma\$\${\textbackslash}delta\$ T cells. As the transcriptional programs of human and mouse cells are highly conserved, it is likely that many lessons learned from the mouse model apply to humans.},

We conducted a study to determine whether adding ch14.18, {GM}-{CSF}, and interleukin-2 to standard isotretinoin therapy after intensive multimodal therapy would improve outcomes in high-risk neuroblastoma. {METHODS}: Patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who had a response to induction therapy and stem-cell transplantation were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive standard therapy (six cycles of isotretinoin) or immunotherapy (six cycles of isotretinoin and five concomitant cycles of ch14.18 in combination with alternating {GM}-{CSF} and interleukin-2). Event-free survival and overall survival were compared between the immunotherapy group and the standard-therapy group, on an intention-to-treat basis. {RESULTS}: A total of 226 eligible patients were randomly assigned to a treatment group.

Inferring gene regulatory networks from high-throughput microarray expression data is a fundamental but challenging task in computational systems biology and its translation to genomic medicine. Although diverse computational and statistical approaches have been brought to bear on the gene regulatory network inference problem, their relative strengths and disadvantages remain poorly understood, largely because comparative analyses usually consider only small subsets of methods, use only synthetic data, and/or fail to adopt a common measure of inference quality.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\${nMETHODS}: We report a comprehensive comparative evaluation of nine state-of-the art gene regulatory network inference methods encompassing the main algorithmic approaches (mutual information, correlation, partial correlation, random forests, support vector machines) using 38 simulated datasets and empirical serous papillary ovarian adenocarcinoma expression-microarray data. We then apply the best-performing method to infer normal and cancer networks. We assess the druggability of the proteins encoded by our predicted target genes using the {CancerResource} and {PharmGKB} webtools and databases.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\${nRESULTS}: We observe large differences in the accuracy with which these methods predict the underlying gene regulatory network depending on features of the data, network size, topology, experiment type, and parameter settings.

For selected novel interactions we propose testable mechanistic models linking gene regulation to cancer. Using network analysis and visualization, we uncover cross-regulation of angiogenesis-specific genes through three key transcription factors in normal and cancer conditions. Druggabilty analysis of proteins encoded by the 10 highest-confidence target genes, and by 15 genes with differential regulation in normal and cancer conditions, reveals 75\% to be potential drug targets.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\${nCONCLUSIONS}: Our study represents a concrete application of gene regulatory network inference to ovarian cancer, demonstrating the complete cycle of computational systems biology research, from genome-scale data analysis via network inference, evaluation of methods, to the generation of novel testable hypotheses, their prioritization for experimental validation, and discovery of potential drug targets.},

	title = {{SCOUT}: simultaneous time segmentation and community detection in dynamic networks},
	abstract = {Many evolving complex systems can be modeled via dynamic networks. An important problem in dynamic network research is community detection, which identifies groups of topologically related nodes. Typically, this problem is approached by assuming either that each time point has a distinct community organization or that all time points share one community organiza-tion. In reality, the truth likely lies between these two extremes, since some time periods can have community organization that evolves while others can have community organization that stays the same. To find the compromise, we consider community detection in the context of the problem of segment detection, which identifies contiguous time periods with consistent network structure. Consequently, we formulate a combined problem of segment community detection ({SCD}), which simultaneously partitions the network into contiguous time segments with consis-tent community organization and finds this community organization for each segment. To solve {SCD}, we introduce {SCOUT}, an optimization framework that explicitly considers both segmen-tation quality and partition quality. {SCOUT} addresses limitations of existing methods that can be adapted to solve {SCD}, which typically consider only one of segmentation quality or partition quality. In a thorough evaluation, {SCOUT} outperforms the existing methods in terms of both accuracy and computational complexity.},

	abstract = {When analyzing single-cell {RNA}-seq data, constructing a pseudo-temporal path to order cells based on the gradual transition of their transcriptomes is a useful way to study gene expression dynamics in a heterogeneous cell population. Currently, a limited number of computational tools are available for this task, and quantitative methods for comparing different tools are lacking. Tools for Single Cell Analysis ({TSCAN}) is a software tool developed to better support in silico pseudo-Time reconstruction in Single-Cell {RNA}-seq {ANalysis}. {TSCAN} uses a cluster-based minimum spanning tree ({MST}) approach to order cells. Cells are first grouped into clusters and an {MST} is then constructed to connect cluster centers. Pseudo-time is obtained by projecting each cell onto the tree, and the ordered sequence of cells can be used to study dynamic changes of gene expression along the pseudo-time. Clustering cells before {MST} construction reduces the complexity of the tree space. This often leads to improved cell ordering. It also allows users to conveniently adjust the ordering based on prior knowledge. {TSCAN} has a graphical user interface ({GUI}) to support data visualization and user interaction. Furthermore, quantitative measures are developed to objectively evaluate and compare different pseudo-time reconstruction methods. {TSCAN} is available at https://github.com/zji90/{TSCAN} and as a Bioconductor package.},

We demonstrate that different stem/progenitor populations are characterized by distinctive transcription factor expression states, and through comprehensive bioinformatic analysis reveal positively and negatively correlated transcription factor pairings, including previously unrecognized relationships between Gata2, Gfi1 and Gfi1b. Validation using transcriptional and transgenic assays confirmed direct regulatory interactions consistent with a regulatory triad in immature blood stem cells, where Gata2 may function to modulate cross-inhibition between Gfi1 and Gfi1b. Single-cell expression profiling therefore identifies network states and allows reconstruction of network hierarchies involved in controlling stem cell fate choices, and provides a blueprint for studying both normal development and human disease.},

Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment."

We consider five survival prediction models consisting of one clinical model, two gene expression models, and two models from combinations of clinical and gene expression models.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\${nRESULTS}: A public breast cancer dataset was used to compare several performance metrics using five prediction models. 1) For some prediction models, the hazard ratio from fitting a Cox proportional hazards model was significant, but the two-group comparison was insignificant, and vice versa. 2) The randomization test and cross-validation were generally consistent with the p-values obtained from the standard performance metrics. 3) Binary classifiers highly depended on how the risk groups were defined; a slight change of the survival threshold for assignment of classes led to very different prediction results.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\${nCONCLUSIONS}: 1) Different performance metrics for evaluation of a survival prediction model may give different conclusions in its discriminatory ability. 2) Evaluation using a high-risk versus low-risk group comparison depends on the selected risk-score threshold; a plot of p-values from all possible thresholds can show the sensitivity of the threshold selection. 3) A randomization test of the significance of Somers' rank correlation can be used for further evaluation of performance of a prediction model. 4) The cross-validated power of survival prediction models decreases as the training and test sets become less balanced.},

	abstract = {Biological gene networks appear to be dynamically robust to mutation, stochasticity, and changes in the environment and also appear to be sparsely connected. Studies with computational models, however, have suggested that denser gene networks evolve to be more dynamically robust than sparser networks. We resolve this discrepancy by showing that misassumptions about how to measure robustness in artificial networks have inadvertently discounted the costs of network complexity. We show that when the costs of complexity are taken into account, that robustness implies a parsimonious network structure that is sparsely connected and not unnecessarily complex; and that selection will favor sparse networks when network topology is free to evolve. Because a robust system of heredity is necessary for the adaptive evolution of complex phenotypes, the maintenance of frugal network complexity is likely a crucial design constraint that underlies biological organization.},

	abstract = {An important problem in systems biology is to reconstruct gene regulatory networks ({GRNs}) from experimental data and other a priori information. The {DREAM} project offers some types of experimental data, such as knockout data, knockdown data, time series data, etc. Among them, multifactorial perturbation data are easier and less expensive to obtain than other types of experimental data and are thus more common in practice. In this article, a new algorithm is presented for the inference of {GRNs} using the {DREAM}4 multifactorial perturbation data. The {GRN} inference problem among [Formula: see text] genes is decomposed into [Formula: see text] different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression level of a target gene is predicted solely from the expression level of a potential regulation gene. For different potential regulation genes, different weights for a specific target gene are constructed by using the sum of squared residuals and the Pearson correlation coefficient. Then these weights are normalized to reflect effort differences of regulating distinct genes. By appropriately choosing the parameters of the power law, we constructe a 0-1 integer programming problem. By solving this problem, direct regulation genes for an arbitrary gene can be estimated. And, the normalized weight of a gene is modified, on the basis of the estimation results about the existence of direct regulations to it. These normalized and modified weights are used in queuing the possibility of the existence of a corresponding direct regulation. Computation results with the {DREAM}4 In Silico Size 100 Multifactorial subchallenge show that estimation performances of the suggested algorithm can even outperform the best team. Using the real data provided by the {DREAM}5 Network Inference Challenge, estimation performances can be ranked third. Furthermore, the high precision of the obtained most reliable predictions shows the suggested algorithm may be helpful in guiding biological experiment designs.},

	abstract = {Identifying the genes that change their expressions between two conditions (such as normal versus cancer) is a crucial task that can help in understanding the causes of diseases. Differential networking has emerged as a powerful approach to detect the changes in network structures and to identify the differentially connected genes among two networks. However, existing differential network-based methods primarily depend on pairwise comparisons of the genes based on their connectivity. Therefore, these methods cannot capture the essential topological changes in the network structures. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, {DiffRank}, which ranks the genes based on their contribution to the differences between the two networks. To achieve this goal, we define two novel structural scoring measures: a local structure measure (differential connectivity) and a global structure measure (differential betweenness centrality). These measures are optimized by propagating the scores through the network structure and then ranking the genes based on these propagated scores. We demonstrate the effectiveness of {DiffRank} on synthetic and real datasets. For the synthetic datasets, we developed a simulator for generating synthetic differential scale-free networks, and we compared our method with existing methods. The comparisons show that our algorithm outperforms these existing methods. For the real datasets, we apply the proposed algorithm on several gene expression datasets and demonstrate that the proposed method provides biologically interesting results.},

Here we sequence single-cell {RNA}-seq libraries prepared from over 1,700 primary mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells spanning several experimental conditions. We find substantial variation between identically stimulated dendritic cells, in both the fraction of cells detectably expressing a given messenger {RNA} and the transcript's level within expressing cells. Distinct gene modules are characterized by different temporal heterogeneity profiles. In particular, a 'core' module of antiviral genes is expressed very early by a few 'precocious' cells in response to uniform stimulation with a pathogenic component, but is later activated in all cells. By stimulating cells individually in sealed microfluidic chambers, analysing dendritic cells from knockout mice, and modulating secretion and extracellular signalling, we show that this response is coordinated by interferon-mediated paracrine signalling from these precocious cells. Notably, preventing cell-to-cell communication also substantially reduces variability between cells in the expression of an early-induced 'peaked' inflammatory module, suggesting that paracrine signalling additionally represses part of the inflammatory program. Our study highlights the importance of cell-to-cell communication in controlling cellular heterogeneity and reveals general strategies that multicellular populations can use to establish complex dynamic responses.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Transcriptional regulatory networks controlling cell fate decisions in mammalian embryonic development remain elusive despite a long time of research. The recent emergence of single-cell {RNA} profiling technology raises hope for new discovery. Although experimental works have obtained intriguing insights into the mouse early development, a holistic and systematic view is still missing. Mathematical models of cell fates tend to be concept-based, not designed to learn from real data. To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms behind cell fate decisions, it is highly desirable to synthesize the data-driven and knowledge-driven modeling approaches. {RESULTS}: We propose a novel method that integrates the structure of a cell lineage tree with transcriptional patterns from single-cell data. This method adopts probabilistic Boolean network ({PBN}) for network modeling, and genetic algorithm as search strategy. Guided by the 'directionality' of cell development along branches of the cell lineage tree, our method is able to accurately infer the regulatory circuits from single-cell gene expression data, in a holistic way. Applied on the single-cell transcriptional data of mouse preimplantation development, our algorithm outperforms conventional methods of network inference. Given the network topology, our method can also identify the operational interactions in the gene regulatory network ({GRN}), corresponding to specific cell fate determination. This is one of the first attempts to infer {GRNs} from single-cell transcriptional data, incorporating dynamics of cell development along a cell lineage tree. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Implementation of our algorithm is available from the authors upon request. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

We study how the cells develop from undifferentiated cells to differentiated cells from landscape perspectives. We quantified the Waddington landscape through construction of underlying probability landscape for cell development. We show the developmental process proceeds as moving from undifferentiated to the differentiated basins of attractions. The barrier height of the basins of attractions correlates with the escape time that determines the stability of cell types. We show that the developmental process can be quantitatively described and uncovered by the biological paths on the quantified Waddington landscape from undifferentiated to the differentiated cells. We found the dynamics of the developmental process is controlled by a combination of the gradient and curl force on the landscape. The biological paths often do not follow the steepest descent path on the landscape. The landscape framework also quantifies the possibility of reverse differentiation process such as cell reprogramming from differentiated cells back to the original stem cell. We show that the biological path of reverse differentiation is irreversible and different from the one for differentiation process. We found that the developmental process described by the underlying landscape and the associated biological paths is relatively stable and robust against the influences of environmental perturbations.},

	abstract = {Understanding how regulatory networks globally coordinate the response of a cell to changing conditions, such as perturbations by shifting environments, is an elementary challenge in systems biology which has yet to be met. Genome-wide gene expression measurements are high dimensional as these are reflecting the condition-specific interplay of thousands of cellular components. The integration of prior biological knowledge into the modeling process of systems-wide gene regulation enables the large-scale interpretation of gene expression signals in the context of known regulatory relations. We developed {COGERE} (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/cogere), a method for the inference of condition-specific gene regulatory networks in human and mouse. We integrated existing knowledge of regulatory interactions from multiple sources to a comprehensive model of prior information. {COGERE} infers condition-specific regulation by evaluating the mutual dependency between regulator (transcription factor or {miRNA}) and target gene expression using prior information. This dependency is scored by the non-parametric, nonlinear correlation coefficient \${\textbackslash}eta\$(2) (eta squared) that is derived by a two-way analysis of variance. We show that {COGERE} significantly outperforms alternative methods in predicting condition-specific gene regulatory networks on simulated data sets. Furthermore, by inferring the cancer-specific gene regulatory network from the {NCI}-60 expression study, we demonstrate the utility of {COGERE} to promote hypothesis-driven clinical research.},

To determine the genetic basis for neuroblastoma, we performed whole-genome sequencing (6 cases), exome sequencing (16 cases), genome-wide rearrangement analyses (32 cases) and targeted analyses of specific genomic loci (40 cases) using massively parallel sequencing. On average, each tumor had 19 somatic alterations in coding genes (range of 3-70). Among genes not previously known to be involved in neuroblastoma, chromosomal deletions and sequence alterations of the chromatin-remodeling genes {ARID}1A and {ARID}1B were identified in 8 of 71 tumors (11\%) and were associated with early treatment failure and decreased survival. Using tumor-specific structural alterations, we developed an approach to identify rearranged {DNA} fragments in sera, providing personalized biomarkers for minimal residual disease detection and monitoring.

However, both of these populations are heterogenous, which hampers investigation into the molecular changes that occur as lymphoid progenitors commit to the B cell lineage. Here, we demonstrate that there are {PDCA}-1(+)Siglec H(+) plasmacytoid dendritic cells ({pDCs}) that co-purify with {BLPs} and Pre-pro B cells, which express little or no {CD}11c or Ly6C. Removal of {PDCA}-1(+) {pDCs} separates B cell progenitors that express high levels of a Rag1-{GFP} reporter from Rag1-{GFP}(low/neg) {pDCs} within the {BLP} and Pre-pro B populations. Analysis of Flt3-ligand knockout and {IL}-7Rα knockout mice revealed that there is a block in B cell development at the all-lymphoid progenitor ({ALP}) stage, as the majority of cells within the {BLP} or Pre-pro B gates were {PDCA}-1(+) {pDCs}. Thus, removal of {PDCA}-1(+) {pDCs} is critical for analysis of {BLP} and Pre-pro B cell populations. Analysis of B cell potential within the B220(+){CD}19(-) fraction demonstrated that {AA}4.1(+)Ly6D(+){PDCA}-1(-) Pre-pro B cells gave rise to {CD}19(+) B cells at high frequency, while {PDCA}-1(+) {pDCs} in this fraction did not. Interestingly, the presence of {PDCA}-1(+) {pDCs} within {CLPs} may help to explain the conflicting results regarding the origin of these cells.},

This graph is then partitioned (clustering) or used to redefine metric information (dimensionality reduction). There has been much recent work on new methods for graph-based clustering and dimensionality reduction, but not much on constructing the graph itself. Graphs typically used include the fullyconnected graph, a local fixed-grid graph (for image segmentation) or a nearest-neighbor graph. We suggest that the graph should adapt locally to the structure of the data. This can be achieved by a graph ensemble that combines multiple minimum spanning trees, each fit to a perturbed version of the data set. We show that such a graph ensemble usually produces a better representation of the data manifold than standard methods; and that it provides robustness to a subsequent clustering or dimensionality reduction algorithm based on the graph. 1},

Results: In an application to a microarray data set our proposed method, {GPseudoRank}, identifies two modes of the distribution, each of them cor- responding to point estimates of orders obtained by a different established method. In an application to {scRNA}-seq data we demonstrate the poten- tial of {GPseudoRank} to identify phases of lower and higher pseudotime uncertainty during a biological process. {GPseudoRank} also correctly iden- tifies cells precocious in their antiviral response.

	abstract = {Summary Objective The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of a real-time (“open-end”) version of the dynamic time warping ({DTW}) algorithm for the recognition of motor exercises. Given a possibly incomplete input stream of data and a reference time series, the open-end {DTW} algorithm computes both the size of the prefix of reference which is best matched by the input, and the dissimilarity between the matched portions. The algorithm was used to provide real-time feedback to neurological patients undergoing motor rehabilitation. Methods and materials We acquired a dataset of multivariate time series from a sensorized long-sleeve shirt which contains 29 strain sensors distributed on the upper limb. Seven typical rehabilitation exercises were recorded in several variations, both correctly and incorrectly executed, and at various speeds, totaling a data set of 840 time series. Nearest-neighbour classifiers were built according to the outputs of open-end {DTW} alignments and their global counterparts on exercise pairs. The classifiers were also tested on well-known public datasets from heterogeneous domains. Results Nonparametric tests show that (1) on full time series the two algorithms achieve the same classification accuracy (p-value =0.32); (2) on partial time series, classifiers based on open-end {DTW} have a far higher accuracy (\${\textbackslash}kappa\$=0.898 versus \${\textbackslash}kappa\$=0.447;p\${\textbackslash}textless\$10-5); and (3) the prediction of the matched fraction follows closely the ground truth (root mean square \${\textbackslash}textless\$10\%). The results hold for the motor rehabilitation and the other datasets tested, as well. Conclusions The open-end variant of the {DTW} algorithm is suitable for the classification of truncated quantitative time series, even in the presence of noise. Early recognition and accurate class prediction can be achieved, provided that enough variance is available over the time span of the reference. Therefore, the proposed technique expands the use of {DTW} to a wider range of applications, such as real-time biofeedback systems.},

More specifically, this gene functions in the emergence of the hematopoietic progenitor cells from the hemogenic endothelium by budding in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region, and its expression points to the sites with strong potential for the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells.

	doi = {10.1016/j.ins.2014.02.096},
	abstract = {An important problem in bioinformatics is the inference of gene regulatory networks ({GRNs}) from expression profiles. In general, the main limitations faced by {GRN} inference methods are the small number of samples with huge dimensionalities and the noisy nature of the expression measurements. Alternatives are thus needed to obtain better accuracy for the {GRNs} inference problem. Many pattern recognition techniques rely on prior knowledge about the problem in addition to the training data to gain statistical estimation power. This work addresses the {GRN} inference problem by modeling prior knowledge about the network topology. The main contribution of this paper is a novel methodology that aggregates scale-free properties to a classical low-cost feature selection method, known as Sequential Floating Forward Selection ({SFFS}), for guiding the inference task. Such methodology explores the search space iteratively by applying a scale-free property to reduce the search space. In this way, the search space traversed by the method integrates the exploration of all combinations of predictors set when the number of combinations is small (dimensionality k≤2) with a floating search when the number of combinations becomes explosive (dimensionality k≥3). This process is guided by scale-free prior information. Experimental results using synthetic and real data show that this technique provides smaller estimation errors than those obtained without guiding the {SFFS} application by the scale-free model, thus maintaining the robustness of the {SFFS} method. Therefore, we show that the proposed framework may be applied in combination with other existing {GRN} inference methods to improve the prediction accuracy of networks with scale-free properties. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Principal curves are smooth one-dimensional curves that pass through the middle of a p-dimensional data set, providing a nonlinear summary of the data. They are nonparametric, and their shape is suggested by the data. The algorithm for constructing principal curves starts with some prior summary, such as the usual principal-component line. The curve in each successive iteration is a smooth or local average of the p-dimensional points, where the definition of local is based on the distance in arc length of the projections of the points onto the curve found in the previous iteration. In this article principal curves are defined, an algorithm for their construction is given, some theoretical results are presented, and the procedure is compared to other generalizations of principal components. Two applications illustrate the use of principal curves. The first describes how the principal-curve procedure was used to align the magnets of the Stanford linear collider. The collider uses about 950 magnets in a roughly circular arrangement to bend electron and positron beams and bring them to collision. After construction, it was found that some of the magnets had ended up significantly out of place. As a result, the beams had to be bent too sharply and could not be focused. The engineers realized that the magnets did not have to be moved to their originally planned locations, but rather to a sufficiently smooth arc through the middle of the existing positions. This arc was found using the principal-curve procedure. In the second application, two different assays for gold content in several samples of computer-chip waste appear to show some systematic differences that are blurred by measurement error. The classical approach using linear errors in variables regression can detect systematic linear differences but is not able to account for nonlinearities. When the first linear principal component is replaced with a principal component is replaced with a principal curve, a local "bump" is revealed, and bootstrapping is used to verify its presence.},

	abstract = {The era of genome sequencing has produced long lists of the molecular parts from which cellular machines are constructed. A fundamental goal in systems biology is to understand how cellular behavior emerges from the interaction in time and space of genetically encoded molecular parts, as well as nongenetically encoded small molecules. Networks provide a natural framework for the organization and quantitative representation of all the available data about molecular interactions. The structural and dynamic properties of molecular networks have been the subject of intense research. Despite major advances, bridging network structure to dynamics-and therefore to behavior-remains challenging. A key concept of modern engineering that recurs in the functional analysis of biological networks is modularity. Most approaches to molecular network analysis rely to some extent on the assumption that molecular networks are modular-that is, they are separable and can be studied to some degree in isolation. We describe recent advances in the analysis of modularity in biological networks, focusing on the increasing realization that a dynamic perspective is essential to grouping molecules into modules and determining their collective function.},

One of the major obstacles in developing and evaluating approaches for de-novo gene network reconstruction is the absence of high-quality genome-scale gold-standard networks of direct regulatory interactions. To establish a foundation for assessing the accuracy of de-novo gene network reverse-engineering, we constructed high-quality genome-scale gold-standard networks of direct regulatory interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that incorporate binding and gene knockout data. Then we used 7 performance metrics to assess accuracy of 18 statistical association-based approaches for de-novo network reverse-engineering in 13 different datasets spanning over 4 data types. We found that most reconstructed networks had statistically significant accuracies. We also determined which statistical approaches and datasets/data types lead to networks with better reconstruction accuracies. While we found that de-novo reverse-engineering of the entire network is a challenging problem, it is possible to reconstruct sub-networks around some transcription factors with good accuracy. The latter transcription factors can be identified by assessing their connectivity in the inferred networks. Overall, this study provides the gene network reverse-engineering community with a rigorous assessment of the accuracy of S. cerevisiae gene network reconstruction and variability in performance of various approaches for learning both the entire network and sub-networks around transcription factors.},

This approach allows for stratification of cancer into informative subtypes by clustering together patients with mutations in similar network regions. We demonstrate {NBS} in ovarian, uterine and lung cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas. For each tissue, {NBS} identifies subtypes that are predictive of clinical outcomes such as patient survival, response to therapy or tumor histology. We identify network regions characteristic of each subtype and show how mutation-derived subtypes can be used to train an {mRNA} expression signature, which provides similar information in the absence of {DNA} sequence.},

The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods ({DREAM}) challenge aims to evaluate the success of {GRN} inference algorithms on benchmarks of simulated data. In this article, we present {GENIE}3, a new algorithm for the inference of {GRNs} that was best performer in the {DREAM}4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge. {GENIE}3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target gene) is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes (input genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the {DREAM}4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge simulated data, we show that {GENIE}3 compares favorably with existing algorithms to decipher the genetic regulatory network of Escherichia coli. It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with combinatorial and non-linear interactions, produces directed {GRNs}, and is fast and scalable. In conclusion, we propose a new algorithm for {GRN} inference that performs well on both synthetic and real gene expression data. The algorithm, based on feature selection with tree-based ensemble methods, is simple and generic, making it adaptable to other types of genomic data and interactions.},

	abstract = {Many real world networks are reported to have hierarchically modular organization. However, there exists no algorithm-independent metric to characterize hierarchical modularity in a complex system. The main results of the paper are a set of methods to address this problem. First, classical results from random matrix theory are used to derive the spectrum of a typical stochastic block model hierarchical modular network form. Second, it is shown that hierarchical modularity can be fingerprinted using the spectrum of its largest eigenvalues and gaps between clusters of closely spaced eigenvalues that are well separated from the bulk distribution of eigenvalues around the origin. Third, some well-known results on fingerprinting non-hierarchical modularity in networks automatically follow as special cases, threreby unifying these previously fragmented results. Finally, using these spectral results, it is found that the limits of detection of modularity can be empirically established by studying the mean values of the largest eigenvalues and the limits of the bulk distribution of eigenvalues for an ensemble of networks. It is shown that even when modularity and hierarchical modularity are present in a weak form in the network, they are impossible to detect, because some of the leading eigenvalues fall within the bulk distribution. This provides a threshold for the detection of modularity. Eigenvalue distributions of some technological, social, and biological networks are studied, and the implications of detecting hierarchical modularity in real world networks are discussed.},

The last several years have witnessed an explosion of new technologies, allowing us to apply even more of the modern molecular biology toolkit to single cells. Conceptual progress, however, has been comparatively slow. Here, we provide a framework for classifying both the origins of the differences between individual cells and the consequences of those differences. We discuss how the concept of “random” differences is context dependent, and propose that rigorous definitions of inputs and outputs may bring clarity to the discussion.

The model leads to a principled statistical estimation procedure that produces more accurate estimates of the mean cell cycle length and the gene expression periodicity than existing heuristic approaches. A central component of the proposed procedure is the resynchronization of the observed transcription profile of each {PE} gene according to the {PNM} with estimated periodicity parameters. By using a two-component mixture-Beta model to approximate the {PNM} fitting residuals, we employ an empirical Bayes method to detect {PE} genes. We estimate that about one-third of the genes in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are likely to be transcribed periodically, and identify 822 genes whose posterior probabilities of being {PE} are greater than 0.95. Among these 822 genes, 540 are also in the list of 800 genes detected by Spellman. Gene ontology annotation analysis shows that many of the 822 genes were involved in important cell cycle-related processes, functions and components. When matching the 822 resynchronized expression profiles of three independent experiments, little phase shifts were observed, indicating that the three synchronization methods might have brought cells to the same phase at the time of release.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}:: It is commonly assumed in pattern recognition that cross-validation error estimation is 'almost unbiased' as long as the number of folds is not too small. While this is true for random sampling, it is not true with separate sampling, where the populations are independently sampled, which is a common situation in bioinformatics. {RESULTS}:: We demonstrate, via analytical and numerical methods, that classical cross-validation can have strong bias under separate sampling, depending on the difference between the sampling ratios and the true population probabilities. We propose a new separate-sampling cross-validation error estimator, and prove that it satisfies an 'almost unbiased' theorem similar to that of random-sampling cross-validation. We present two case studies with previously published data, which show that the results can change drastically if the correct form of cross-validation is used.

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Analogous to biological sequence comparison, comparing cellular networks is an important problem that could provide insight into biological understanding and therapeutics. For technical reasons, comparing large networks is computationally infeasible, and thus heuristics, such as the degree distribution, clustering coefficient, diameter, and relative graphlet frequency distribution have been sought. It is easy to demonstrate that two networks are different by simply showing a short list of properties in which they differ. It is much harder to show that two networks are similar, as it requires demonstrating their similarity in all of their exponentially many properties. Clearly, it is computationally prohibitive to analyze all network properties, but the larger the number of constraints we impose in determining network similarity, the more likely it is that the networks will truly be similar. {RESULTS}: We introduce a new systematic measure of a network's local structure that imposes a large number of similarity constraints on networks being compared. In particular, we generalize the degree distribution, which measures the number of nodes 'touching' k edges, into distributions measuring the number of nodes 'touching' k graphlets, where graphlets are small connected non-isomorphic subgraphs of a large network. Our new measure of network local structure consists of 73 graphlet degree distributions of graphlets with 2-5 nodes, but it is easily extendible to a greater number of constraints (i.e. graphlets), if necessary, and the extensions are limited only by the available {CPU}. Furthermore, we show a way to combine the 73 graphlet degree distributions into a network 'agreement' measure which is a number between 0 and 1, where 1 means that networks have identical distributions and 0 means that they are far apart. Based on this new network agreement measure, we show that almost all of the 14 eukaryotic {PPI} networks, including human, resulting from various high-throughput experimental techniques, as well as from curated databases, are better modeled by geometric random graphs than by Erdös-Rény, random scale-free, or Barabási-Albert scale-free networks. {AVAILABILITY}: Software executables are available upon request.},

We examined different mouse bone marrow ({BM}) hemopoietic precursor populations for the surface expression of Flt3 and tested them for early {DC} and p-{preDC} precursor activity. Most {DC} precursor activity, other than that given by multipotent hemopoietic stem cells, was within the downstream precursors expressing Flt3. The majority of mouse {BM} common lymphoid precursors expressed high levels of Flt3 and these were the most efficient precursors of both {DCs} and p-{preDCs}. In contrast, only a small proportion of the common myeloid precursors ({CMPs}) expressed Flt3, but the precursor activity for both {DCs} and p-{preDCs} was within this minor Flt3+ {CMP} fraction. The granulocyte and macrophage precursors and pro-B cells did not express Flt3 and had no {DC} or p-{preDC} precursor activity.

A number of well-known graph theoretic clustering methods are compared in terms of their stability as determined by this measure. Specifically, it is shown that among the clustering methods in any of several families of graph theoretic methods, clusters defined as the connected components are the most stable and the clusters specified as the maximal complete subgraphs are the least stable. Furthermore, as one proceeds from the method producing the most narrow clusters (maximal complete subgraphs) to those producing relatively broader clusters, the clustering process is shown to remain at least as stable as any method in the previous stages. Finally, the lower and the upper bounds for the measure of stability, when clusters are defined as the connected components, are derived.},

Inspired by the Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods ({DREAM}) projects, many excellent gene regulatory network inference algorithms have been proposed. However, it is still a challenging problem to infer a gene regulatory network from gene expression data on a large scale. In this paper, we propose a gene regulatory network inference method based on a multi-level strategy ({GENIMS}), which can give results that are more accurate and robust than the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method mainly consists of three levels, which are an original feature selection step based on guided regularized random forest, normalization of individual feature selection and the final refinement step according to the topological property of the gene regulatory network. To prove the accuracy and robustness of our method, we compare our method with the state-of-the-art methods on the {DREAM}4 and {DREAM}5 benchmark networks and the results indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of gene regulatory network inference. Additionally, we also discuss the influence of the selection of different parameters in our method.},

Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell {RNA}-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation.},

Wishbone uses multi-dimensional single-cell data, such as mass cytometry or {RNA}-Seq data, as input and orders cells according to their developmental progression, and it pinpoints bifurcation points by labeling each cell as pre-bifurcation or as one of two post-bifurcation cell fates. Using 30-channel mass cytometry data, we show that Wishbone accurately recovers the known stages of T-cell development in the mouse thymus, including the bifurcation point. We also apply the algorithm to mouse myeloid differentiation and demonstrate its generalization to additional lineages. A comparison of Wishbone to diffusion maps, {SCUBA} and Monocle shows that it outperforms these methods both in the accuracy of ordering cells and in the correct identification of branch points.},

Time series from single cell assays are particularly susceptible to confounding as the measurements are not averaged over populations of cells. When several genes are assayed in parallel these effects can be estimated and corrected for under certain smoothness assumptions on cell progression. Results: We present a principled probabilistic model with a Bayesian inference scheme to analyse such data. We demonstrate our method's utility on public microarray, {nCounter} and {RNA}-seq datasets from three organisms. Our method almost perfectly recovers withheld capture times in an Arabidopsis dataset, it accurately estimates cell cycle peak times in a human prostate cancer cell line and it correctly identifies two precocious cells in a study of paracrine signalling in mouse dendritic cells. Furthermore, our method compares favourably with Monocle, a state-of-the-art technique. We also show using held-out data that uncertainty in the temporal dimension is a common confounder and should be accounted for in analyses of repeated cross-sectional time series.Availability and Implementation: Our method is available on {CRAN} in the {DeLorean} package.Contact:john.reid@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.{ukSupplementary} information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and {RNA} samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Many algorithms have been developed to infer the topology of gene regulatory networks from gene expression data. These methods typically produce a ranking of links between genes with associated confidence scores, after which a certain threshold is chosen to produce the inferred topology. However, the structural properties of the predicted network do not resemble those typical for a gene regulatory network, as most algorithms only take into account connections found in the data and do not include known graph properties in their inference process. This lowers the prediction accuracy of these methods, limiting their usability in practice.\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\${nRESULTS}: We propose a post-processing algorithm which is applicable to any confidence ranking of regulatory interactions obtained from a network inference method which can use, inter alia, graphlets and several graph-invariant properties to re-rank the links into a more accurate prediction. To demonstrate the potential of our approach, we re-rank predictions of six different state-of-the-art algorithms using three simple network properties as optimization criteria and show that Netter can improve the predictions made on both artificially generated data as well as the {DREAM}4 and {DREAM}5 benchmarks. Additionally, the {DREAM}5 E.coli. community prediction inferred from real expression data is further improved. Furthermore, Netter compares favorably to other post-processing algorithms and is not restricted to correlation-like predictions. Lastly, we demonstrate that the performance increase is robust for a wide range of parameter settings. Netter is available at http://bioinformatics.intec.ugent.be .\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\${nCONCLUSIONS}: Network inference from high-throughput data is a long-standing challenge. In this work, we present Netter, which can further refine network predictions based on a set of user-defined graph properties. Netter is a flexible system which can be applied in unison with any method producing a ranking from omics data. It can be tailored to specific prior knowledge by expert users but can also be applied in general uses cases. Concluding, we believe that Netter is an interesting second step in the network inference process to further increase the quality of prediction.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Living cells are the product of gene expression programs that involve the regulated transcription of thousands of genes. The elucidation of transcriptional regulatory networks is thus needed to understand the cell's working mechanism, and can for example, be useful for the discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Although several methods have been proposed to infer gene regulatory networks from gene expression data, a recent comparison on a large-scale benchmark experiment revealed that most current methods only predict a limited number of known regulations at a reasonable precision level. {RESULTS}: We propose {SIRENE} (Supervised Inference of Regulatory Networks), a new method for the inference of gene regulatory networks from a compendium of expression data. The method decomposes the problem of gene regulatory network inference into a large number of local binary classification problems, that focus on separating target genes from non-targets for each transcription factor. {SIRENE} is thus conceptually simple and computationally efficient. We test it on a benchmark experiment aimed at predicting regulations in Escherichia coli, and show that it retrieves of the order of 6 times more known regulations than other state-of-the-art inference methods. {AVAILABILITY}: All data and programs are freely available at http://cbio. ensmp.fr/sirene.},

	abstract = {There is considerable interest in the role of the {TRK} family of neuotrophin receptors in regulating growth and differentiation in normal and neoplastic nerve cells. A neuroblastoma is a common pediatric tumor derived from the neural crest, and the majority of favorable neuroblastomas express a high level of {TRK}-A {mRNA}. However, little is known about the expression or function of {TRK}-B in these tumors. {TRK}-B encodes a tyrosine kinase that binds to brain-derived neuotrophic factor ({BDNF}), as well as neurotrophin-3 ({NT}-3) and {NT}-4/5. We have studied the N-myc-amplified human neuroblastoma cell line, {SMS}-{KCN}, which expresses both {TRK}-B and {BDNF}. Exogenous {BDNF} induces tyrosine phosphorylation of {TRK}-B as well as phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. {BDNF} also induces expression of the immediate-early genes c-{FOS} and {NGFI}-A but not {NGFI}-B or {NGFI}-C. In addition, {BDNF} appears to promote cell survival and neurite outgrowth. {SMS}-{KCN} cells also express {TRK}-A, which is phosphorylated in response to nerve growth factor. However, the downstream {TRK}-A signaling is apparently defective. Finally, we determined that in a series of 74 primary neuroblastomas, 36\% express {TRK}-B {mRNA}, 68\% express {BDNF} {mRNA}, and 31\% express both. Truncated {TRK}-B appears to be preferentially expressed in more-differentiated tumors (ganglioneuromas and ganglioneuroblastomas), whereas full-length {TRK}-B is expressed almost exclusively in immature neuroblastomas with N-myc amplification. Our findings suggest that in {TRK}-B-expressing human neuroblastomas, {BDNF} promotes survival and induces neurite outgrowth in an autocrine or paracrine manner. The {BDNF}/{TRK}-B pathway may be particularly important for growth and differentiation of neuroblastomas with N-myc amplification.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Networks have been used to model many real-world phenomena to better understand the phenomena and to guide experiments in order to predict their behavior. Since incorrect models lead to incorrect predictions, it is vital to have as accurate a model as possible. As a result, new techniques and models for analyzing and modeling real-world networks have recently been introduced. {RESULTS}: One example of large and complex networks involves protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) networks. We analyze {PPI} networks of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster using a newly introduced measure of local network structure as well as the standardly used measures of global network structure. We examine the fit of four different network models, including Erdos-Renyi, scale-free and geometric random network models, to these {PPI} networks with respect to the measures of local and global network structure. We demonstrate that the currently accepted scale-free model of {PPI} networks fails to fit the data in several respects and show that a random geometric model provides a much more accurate model of the {PPI} data. We hypothesize that only the noise in these networks is scale-free. {CONCLUSIONS}: We systematically evaluate how well-different network models fit the {PPI} networks. We show that the structure of {PPI} networks is better modeled by a geometric random graph than by a scale-free model. {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary information is available at http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/∼juris/data/data/{ppiGRG}04/},

	abstract = {Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, {microRNA} regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.},

	abstract = {Neuroblastoma is a childhood tumour of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. The pathogenesis has for a long time been quite enigmatic, as only very few gene defects were identified in this often lethal tumour. Frequently detected gene alterations are limited to {MYCN} amplification (20\%) and {ALK} activations (7\%). Here we present a whole-genome sequence analysis of 87 neuroblastoma of all stages. Few recurrent amino-acid-changing mutations were found. In contrast, analysis of structural defects identified a local shredding of chromosomes, known as chromothripsis, in 18\% of high-stage neuroblastoma. These tumours are associated with a poor outcome. Structural alterations recurrently affected {ODZ}3, {PTPRD} and {CSMD}1, which are involved in neuronal growth cone stabilization. In addition, {ATRX}, {TIAM}1 and a series of regulators of the Rac/Rho pathway were mutated, further implicating defects in neuritogenesis in neuroblastoma. Most tumours with defects in these genes were aggressive high-stage neuroblastomas, but did not carry {MYCN} amplifications. The genomic landscape of neuroblastoma therefore reveals two novel molecular defects, chromothripsis and neuritogenesis gene alterations, which frequently occur in high-risk tumours.},

While many methods have been recently developed for this task, their absolute and relative performance remains poorly understood. The present study conducts a rigorous performance assessment of 32 computational methods/variants for de-novo reverse-engineering of genome-scale regulatory networks by benchmarking these methods in 15 high-quality datasets and gold-standards of experimentally verified mechanistic knowledge. The results of this study show that some methods need to be substantially improved upon, while others should be used routinely. Our results also demonstrate that several univariate methods provide a "gatekeeper" performance threshold that should be applied when method developers assess the performance of their novel multivariate algorithms. Finally, the results of this study can be used to show practical utility and to establish guidelines for everyday use of reverse-engineering algorithms, aiming towards creation of automated data-analysis protocols and software systems. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

We highlight 4 research questions that require further investigation in order to make progress in network inference: (1) using overall constraints on network structure such as sparsity, (2) use of informative priors and data integration to constrain individual model parameters, (3) estimation of latent regulatory factor activity under varying cell conditions, and (4) new methods for learning and modeling regulatory factor interactions. We conclude that methods combining advances in these 4 categories of required effort with new genomic technologies will result in biophysically motivated dynamic genome-wide regulatory network models for several of the best-studied organisms and cell types.},

We identified modules of highly coexpressed genes, some of which are restricted to a single lineage but most of which are expressed at variable levels across multiple lineages. We found densely interconnected cis-regulatory circuits and a large number of transcription factors that are differentially expressed across hematopoietic states.

The signaling behavior of cell subsets spanning a defined hematopoietic hierarchy was monitored with 18 simultaneous markers of functional signaling states perturbed by a set of ex vivo stimuli and inhibitors. The data set allowed for an algorithmically driven assembly of related cell types defined by surface antigen expression, providing a superimposable map of cell signaling responses in combination with drug inhibition. Visualized in this manner, the analysis revealed previously unappreciated instances of both precise signaling responses that were bounded within conventionally defined cell subsets and more continuous phosphorylation responses that crossed cell population boundaries in unexpected manners yet tracked closely with cellular phenotype. Collectively, such single-cell analyses provide system-wide views of immune signaling in healthy human hematopoiesis, against which drug action and disease can be compared for mechanistic studies and pharmacologic intervention.},

These tools leverage Biological Networks as a formal model to encode molecular interactions. Biological networks can be fed as input to graph-based techniques useful to infer new information about cellular activity and evolutive processes of the species. In this context, a rather interesting family of techniques is that of network querying. Network querying tools search a whole biological network to identify conserved occurrences of a given query module for transferring biological knowledge. Indeed, inasmuch as the query network generally encodes a well-characterized functional module, its occurrences in the queried network suggest that the latter (and, as such, the corresponding organism) features the function encoded by the former. The aim of this paper is that of analyzing and comparing tools devised to query biological networks.

In this paper, we present a novel algorithm based solely on network topology, that can be used to align any two networks. We apply it to biological networks to produce by far the most complete topological alignments of biological networks to date. We demonstrate that both species phylogeny and detailed biological function of individual proteins can be extracted from our alignments. Topology-based alignments have the potential to provide a completely new, independent source of phylogenetic information. Our alignment of the protein-protein interaction networks of two very different species-yeast and human-indicate that even distant species share a surprising amount of network topology, suggesting broad similarities in internal cellular wiring across all life on Earth.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: Prediction of protein function from protein interaction networks has received attention in the post-genomic era. A popular strategy has been to cluster the network into functionally coherent groups of proteins and assign the entire cluster with a function based on functions of its annotated members. Traditionally, network research has focused on clustering of nodes. However, clustering of edges may be preferred: nodes belong to multiple functional groups, but clustering of nodes typically cannot capture the group overlap, while clustering of edges can. Clustering of adjacent edges that share many neighbors was proposed recently, outperforming different node clustering methods. However, since some biological processes can have characteristic 'signatures' throughout the network, not just locally, it may be of interest to consider edges that are not necessarily adjacent. {RESULTS}: We design a sensitive measure of the 'topological similarity' of edges that can deal with edges that are not necessarily adjacent. We cluster edges that are similar according to our measure in different baker's yeast protein interaction networks, outperforming existing node and edge clustering approaches. We apply our approach to the human network to predict new pathogen-interacting proteins. This is important, since these proteins represent drug target candidates. {AVAILABILITY}: Software executables are freely available upon request. {CONTACT}: tmilenko@nd.edu {SUPPLEMENTARY} {INFORMATION}: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: In a number of domains, like in {DNA} microarray data analysis, we need to cluster simultaneously rows (genes) and columns (conditions) of a data matrix to identify groups of rows coherent with groups of columns. This kind of clustering is called biclustering. Biclustering algorithms are extensively used in {DNA} microarray data analysis. More effective biclustering algorithms are highly desirable and needed. {METHODS}: We introduce {BiMine}, a new enumeration algorithm for biclustering of {DNA} microarray data. The proposed algorithm is based on three original features. First, {BiMine} relies on a new evaluation function called Average Spearman's rho ({ASR}). Second, {BiMine} uses a new tree structure, called Bicluster Enumeration Tree ({BET}), to represent the different biclusters discovered during the enumeration process. Third, to avoid the combinatorial explosion of the search tree, {BiMine} introduces a parametric rule that allows the enumeration process to cut tree branches that cannot lead to good biclusters. {RESULTS}: The performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed using both synthetic and real {DNA} microarray data. The experimental results show that {BiMine} competes well with several other biclustering methods. Moreover, we test the biological significance using a gene annotation web-tool to show that our proposed method is able to produce biologically relevant biclusters. The software is available upon request from the authors to academic users.},

	abstract = {Cell-to-cell variation and heterogeneity are fundamental and intrinsic characteristics of stem cell populations, but these differences are masked when bulk cells are used for omic analysis. Single-cell sequencing technologies serve as powerful tools to dissect cellular heterogeneity comprehensively and to identify distinct phenotypic cell types, even within a 'homogeneous' stem cell population. These technologies, including single-cell genome, epigenome, and transcriptome sequencing technologies, have been developing rapidly in recent years. The application of these methods to different types of stem cells, including pluripotent stem cells and tissue-specific stem cells, has led to exciting new findings in the stem cell field. In this review, we discuss the recent progress as well as future perspectives in the methodologies and applications of single-cell omic sequencing technologies.},

	abstract = {A complex disease generally results not from malfunction of individual molecules but from dysfunction of the relevant system or network, which dynamically changes with time and conditions. Thus, estimating a condition-specific network from a single sample is crucial to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of complex diseases at the system level. However, there is currently no effective way to construct such an individual-specific network by expression profiling of a single sample because of the requirement of multiple samples for computing correlations. We developed here with a statistical method, i.e. a sample-specific network ({SSN}) method, which allows us to construct individual-specific networks based on molecular expressions of a single sample. Using this method, we can characterize various human diseases at a network level. In particular, such {SSNs} can lead to the identification of individual-specific disease modules as well as driver genes, even without gene sequencing information. Extensive analysis by using the Cancer Genome Atlas data not only demonstrated the effectiveness of the method, but also found new individual-specific driver genes and network patterns for various types of cancer. Biological experiments on drug resistance further validated one important advantage of our method over the traditional methods, i.e. we can even identify such drug resistance genes that actually have no clear differential expression between samples with and without the resistance, due to the additional network information.},

The result is that the authors' method tends to be the best in an unreasonable majority of cases (Table I). In many instances, this bias is the result of selective reporting of performance in the niche in which the method is superior. Evidence of that is that most papers reporting best performance choose only one or two metrics of performance, but when the number of performance metrics is larger than two, most methods fail to be the best in all categories assessed (Table I). Choosing many metrics can dramatically change the determination of best performance (Supplementary Table S1). Selective reporting can be inadvertent, but in some cases biases are more disingenuous, involving hiding information or quietly cutting corners in the performance evaluation (similar problems have been discussed in assessments of the performance of supercomputers, e.g., Bailey (1991)).\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\${nView} this table:\${\textbackslash}backslash\$n\${\textbackslash}backslash\${nTable} 1.

	abstract = {We introduce a novel graph-based kernel method for annotating functional residues in protein structures. A structure is first modeled as a protein contact graph, where nodes correspond to residues and edges connect spatially neighboring residues. Each vertex in the graph is then represented as a vector of counts of labeled non-isomorphic subgraphs (graphlets), centered on the vertex of interest. A similarity measure between two vertices is expressed as the inner product of their respective count vectors and is used in a supervised learning framework to classify protein residues. We evaluated our method on two function prediction problems: identification of catalytic residues in proteins, which is a well-studied problem suitable for benchmarking, and a much less explored problem of predicting phosphorylation sites in protein structures. The performance of the graphlet kernel approach was then compared against two alternative methods, a sequence-based predictor and our implementation of the {FEATURE} framework. On both tasks, the graphlet kernel performed favorably; however, the margin of difference was considerably higher on the problem of phosphorylation site prediction. While there is data that phosphorylation sites are preferentially positioned in intrinsically disordered regions, we provide evidence that for the sites that are located in structured regions, neither the surface accessibility alone nor the averaged measures calculated from the residue microenvironments utilized by {FEATURE} were sufficient to achieve high accuracy. The key benefit of the graphlet representation is its ability to capture neighborhood similarities in protein structures via enumerating the patterns of local connectivity in the corresponding labeled graphs.},

Here we describe a strategy to address this problem that combines gene expression profiling of large numbers of single cells with data analysis based on diffusion maps for dimensionality reduction and network synthesis from state transition graphs. Applying the approach to hematopoietic development in the mouse embryo, we map the progression of mesoderm toward blood using single-cell gene expression analysis of 3,934 cells with blood-forming potential captured at four time points between E7.0 and E8.5. Transitions between individual cellular states are then used as input to develop a single-cell network synthesis toolkit to generate a computationally executable transcriptional regulatory network model of blood development. Several model predictions concerning the roles of Sox and Hox factors are validated experimentally. Our results demonstrate that single-cell analysis of a developing organ coupled with computational approaches can reveal the transcriptional programs that underpin organogenesis.},

Although many methods exist for extracting these sub-networks, very few existing approaches simultaneously consider both the differential expression of individual genes and the differential correlation of gene pairs, losing potentially valuable information in the data. {RESULTS}: In this article, we propose a new method, {COSINE} ({COndition} {SpecIfic} sub-{NEtwork}), which employs a scoring function that jointly measures the condition-specific changes of both 'nodes' (individual genes) and 'edges' (gene-gene co-expression). It uses the genetic algorithm to search for the single optimal sub-network which maximizes the scoring function. We applied {COSINE} to both simulated datasets with various differential expression patterns, and three real datasets, one prostate cancer dataset, a second one from the across-tissue comparison of morbidly obese patients and the other from the across-population comparison of the {HapMap} samples. Compared with previous methods, {COSINE} is more powerful in identifying truly significant sub-networks of appropriate size and meaningful biological relevance. {AVAILABILITY}: The R code is available as the {COSINE} package on {CRAN}: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/{COSINE}/index.html.},

	abstract = {Network inference is a rapidly advancing field, with new methods being proposed on a regular basis. Understanding the advantages and limitations of different network inference methods is key to their effective application in different circumstances. The common structural properties shared by diverse networks naturally pose a challenge when it comes to devising accurate inference methods, but surprisingly, there is a paucity of comparison and evaluation methods. Historically, every new methodology has only been tested against gold standard (true values) purpose-designed synthetic and real-world (validated) biological networks. In this paper we aim to assess the impact of taking into consideration aspects of topological and information content in the evaluation of the final accuracy of an inference procedure. Specifically, we will compare the best inference methods, in both graph-theoretic and information-theoretic terms, for preserving topological properties and the original information content of synthetic and biological networks. New methods for performance comparison are introduced by borrowing ideas from gene set enrichment analysis and by applying concepts from algorithmic complexity. Experimental results show that no individual algorithm outperforms all others in all cases, and that the challenging and non-trivial nature of network inference is evident in the struggle of some of the algorithms to turn in a performance that is superior to random guesswork. Therefore special care should be taken to suit the method to the purpose at hand. Finally, we show that evaluations from data generated using different underlying topologies have different signatures that can be used to better choose a network reconstruction method.},

We consider several criteria for building good benchmarks and the advantages to be gained when they are used intelligently. To illustrate these principles, we present a more detailed discussion of benchmarks for multiple alignments of protein sequences.

We found that the amount of protein synthesized per hour in {HSCs} in vivo was lower than in most other haematopoietic cells, even if we controlled for differences in cell cycle status or forced {HSCs} to undergo self-renewing divisions. Reduced ribosome function in Rpl24(Bst/+) mice further reduced protein synthesis in {HSCs} and impaired {HSC} function. Pten deletion increased protein synthesis in {HSCs} but also reduced {HSC} function. Rpl24(Bst/+) cell-autonomously rescued the effects of Pten deletion in {HSCs}; blocking the increase in protein synthesis, restoring {HSC} function, and delaying leukaemogenesis. Pten deficiency thus depletes {HSCs} and promotes leukaemia partly by increasing protein synthesis. Either increased or decreased protein synthesis impairs {HSC} function.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally, the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal. {PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS}: To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed "Enrichment Map", a network-based visualization method for gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where each set is a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups related gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the enrichment results. {CONCLUSIONS}: Enrichment Map is a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any research project that generates a list of genes can take advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment Map is implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for the Cytoscape network visualization software (http://baderlab.org/Software/{EnrichmentMap}/).},

Within the {DREAM}4 initiative, we took part in the multifactorial sub-challenge that aimed to predict gene regulatory networks of size 100 from training data consisting of steady-state levels obtained after applying multifactorial perturbations to the original in silico network. Due to the static character of the challenge data, we tackled the problem via a sparse Gaussian Markov Random Field, which relates network topology with the covariance inverse generated by the gene measurements. As for the computations, we used the Graphical Lasso algorithm which provided a large range of candidate network topologies. The main task was to select the optimal network topology and for that, different model selection criteria were explored. The selected networks were compared with the golden standards and the results ranked using the scoring metrics applied in the challenge, giving a better insight in our submission and the way to improve it.Our approach provides an easy statistical and computational framework to infer gene regulatory networks that is suitable for large networks, even if the number of the observations (perturbations) is greater than the number of variables (genes).},

Altogether we generated 10 datasets using a combination of droplet and plate-based {scRNA}-seq protocols, with varying data quality, population heterogeneity and noise levels. Using these benchmark datasets, we compared different protocols, evaluated the spike-in standard and multiple data analysis methods for tasks ranging from normalization and imputation, to clustering, trajectory analysis and data integration. Evaluation of methods across multiple datasets revealed some that performed well in general and others that suited specific situations. Our dataset and analysis provide a comprehensive comparison framework for benchmarking most popular {scRNA}-seq analysis tasks.},

In this study, we aimed for comprehensive genetic subgroup discovery and assessment of independent prognostic markers based on genome-wide aberrations detected by comparative genomic hybridization ({CGH}). {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: Published {CGH} data from 231 primary untreated neuroblastomas were converted to a digitized format suitable for global data mining, subgroup discovery, and multivariate survival analyses. {RESULTS}: In contrast to previous reports, which included only a few genetic parameters, we present here for the first time a strategy that allows unbiased evaluation of all genetic imbalances detected by {CGH}. The presented approach firmly established the existence of three different clinicogenetic subgroups and indicated that chromosome 17 status and tumor stage were the only independent significant predictors for patient outcome. Important new findings were: (1) a normal chromosome 17 status as a delineator of a subgroup of presumed favorable-stage tumors with highly increased risk; (2) the recognition of a survivor signature conferring 100\% 5-year survival for stage 1, 2, and 4S tumors presenting with whole chromosome 17 gain; and (3) the identification of 3p deletion as a hallmark of older age at diagnosis. {CONCLUSION}: We propose a new regression model for improved patient outcome prediction, incorporating tumor stage, chromosome 17, and amplification/deletion status. These findings may prove highly valuable with respect to more reliable risk assessment, evaluation of clinical results, and optimization of current treatment protocols.},

Using single-molecule counting and computational image analysis, we show that transcript abundance correlates with cellular volume at the single-cell level due to increased global transcription in larger cells. Cell fusion experiments establish that increased cellular content itself can directly increase transcription. Quantitative analysis shows that this mechanism measures the ratio of cellular volume to {DNA} content, most likely through sequestration of a transcriptional factor to {DNA}. Analysis of transcriptional bursts reveals a separate mechanism for gene dosage compensation after {DNA} replication that enables proper transcriptional output during early and late S phase.

However, the analysis of time series single cell {RNA}-Seq data raises several new computational challenges. Cells at each time point are often sampled from a mixture of cell types, each of which may be a progenitor of one, or several, specific fates making it hard to determine which cells should be used to reconstruct temporal trajectories. In addition, cells, even from the same time point, may be unsynchronized making it hard to rely on the measured time for determining these trajectories.{ResultsWe} present {TASIC} a new method for determining temporal trajectories, branching and cell assignments in single cell time series experiments. Unlike prior approaches {TASIC} uses on a probabilistic graphical model to integrate expression and time information making it more robust to noise and stochastic variations. Applying {TASIC} to in vitro myoblast differentiation and in-vivo lung development data we show that it accurately reconstructs developmental trajectories from single cell experiments.

Robust inference of cell state transition paths and probabilities is an important yet challenging step in the analysis of these data. Results: Here we present {scEpath}, an algorithm that calculates energy landscapes and probabilistic directed graphs in order to reconstruct developmental trajectories. We quantify the energy landscape using "single-cell energy" and distance-based measures, and find that the combination of these enables robust inference of the transition probabilities and lineage relationships between cell states. We also identify marker genes and gene expression patterns associated with cell state transitions. Our approach produces pseudotemporal orderings that are - in combination - more robust and accurate than current methods, and offers higher resolution dynamics of the cell state transitions, leading to new insight into key transition events during differentiation and development. Moreover, {scEpath} is robust to variation in the size of the input gene set, and is broadly unsupervised, requiring few parameters to be set by the user. Applications of {scEpath} led to the identification of a cell-cell communication network implicated in early human embryo development, and novel transcription factors important for myoblast differentiation. {scEpath} allows us to identify common and specific temporal dynamics and transcriptional factor programs along branched lineages, as well as the transition probabilities that control cell fates.

	abstract = {Trajectory inference has radically enhanced single-cell {RNA}-seq research by enabling the study of dynamic changes in gene expression levels during biological processes such as the cell cycle, cell type differentiation, and cellular activation. Downstream of trajectory inference, it is vital to discover genes that are associated with the lineages in the trajectory to illuminate the underlying biological processes. Furthermore, genes that are differentially expressed between developmental/activational lineages might be highly relevant to further unravel the system under study. Current data analysis procedures, however, typically cluster cells and assess differential expression between the clusters, which fails to exploit the continuous resolution provided by trajectory inference to its full potential. The few available non-cluster-based methods only assess broad differences in gene expression between lineages, hence failing to pinpoint the exact types of divergence. We introduce a powerful generalized additive model framework based on the negative binomial distribution that allows flexible inference of (i) within-lineage differential expression by detecting associations between gene expression and pseudotime over an entire lineage or by comparing gene expression between points/regions within the lineage and (ii) between-lineage differential expression by comparing gene expression between lineages over the entire lineages or at specific points/regions. By incorporating observation-level weights, the model additionally allows to account for zero inflation, commonly observed in single-cell {RNA}-seq data from full-length protocols. We evaluate the method on simulated and real datasets from droplet-based and full-length protocols, and show that the flexible inference framework is capable of yielding biological insights through a clear interpretation of the data.},

The recovery of pseudotime increases the temporal resolution of single-cell transcriptional data, but is challenging due to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells. Here, we introduce {HopLand}, a pseudotime recovery method using continuous Hopfield network to map cells to a Waddington's epigenetic landscape. It reveals from the single-cell data the combinatorial regulatory interactions among genes that control the dynamic progression through successive cell states. Results: We applied {HopLand} to different types of single-cell transcriptomic data. It achieved high accuracies of pseudotime prediction compared with existing methods. Moreover, a kinetic model can be extracted from each dataset. Through the analysis of such a model, we identified key genes and regulatory interactions driving the transition of cell states. Therefore, our method has the potential to generate fundamental insights into cell fate regulation.Availability and implementation: The {MATLAB} implementation of {HopLand} is available at https://github.com/{NetLand}-{NTU}/{HopLand}.Contact:zhengjie@ntu.edu.sg},

	abstract = {Motivation Many methods have been developed to cluster genes on the basis of their changes in {mRNA} expression over time, using bulk {RNA}-seq or microarray data. However, single-cell data may present a particular challenge for these algorithms, since the temporal ordering of cells is not directly observed. One way to address this is to first use pseudotime methods to order the cells, and then apply clustering techniques for time course data. However, pseudotime estimates are subject to high levels of uncertainty, and failing to account for this uncertainty is liable to lead to erroneous and/or over-confident gene clusters.Results The proposed method, {GPseudoClust}, is a novel approach that jointly infers pseudotem-poral ordering and gene clusters, and quantifies the uncertainty in both. {GPseudoClust} combines a recent method for pseudotime inference with nonparametric Bayesian clustering methods, efficient {MCMC} sampling, and novel subsampling strategies which aid computation. We consider a broad array of simulated and experimental datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of {GPseudoClust} in a range of settings.Availability An implementation is available on {GitHub}: https://github.com/{magStra}/{nonparametricSummaryPSM} and https://github.com/{magStra}/{GPseudoClust}.Contact ms58\{at\}sanger.ac.{ukSupplementary} information Supplementary materials are available.},

	abstract = {As embryos develop, numerous cell types with distinct functions and morphologies arise from pluripotent cells. Three research groups have used single-cell {RNA} sequencing to analyze the transcriptional changes accompanying development of vertebrate embryos (see the Perspective by Harland). Wagner et al. sequenced the transcriptomes of more than 90,000 cells throughout zebrafish development to reveal how cells differentiate during axis patterning, germ layer formation, and early organogenesis. Farrell et al. profiled the transcriptomes of tens of thousands of embryonic cells and applied a computational approach to construct a branching tree describing the transcriptional trajectories that lead to 25 distinct zebrafish cell types. The branching tree revealed how cells change their gene expression as they become more and more specialized. Briggs et al. examined whole frog embryos, spanning zygotic genome activation through early organogenesis, to map cell states and differentiation across all cell lineages over time. These data and approaches pave the way for the comprehensive reconstruction of transcriptional trajectories during development.Science, this issue p. 981, p. eaar3131, p. eaar5780; see also p. 967INTRODUCTIONDuring embryogenesis, pluripotent cells gradually become specialized and acquire distinct functions and morphologies. Because much of the specification process is controlled through changes in gene expression, the identification of the transcriptional trajectories underlying cell fate acquisition is paramount to understanding and manipulating development.{RATIONALETraditional} approaches have studied specific fate decisions by analyzing the transcription of a few selected marker genes or by profiling isolated, predefined cell populations. The advent of large-scale single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) provides the means to comprehensively define the gene expression states of all embryonic cells as they acquire their fates. This technology raises the possibility of identifying the molecular trajectories that describe cell fate specification by sampling densely during embryogenesis and connecting the transcriptomes of cells that have similar gene expression profiles. However, the numerous transcriptional states and branch points, as well as the asynchrony in developmental processes, pose major challenges to the computational reconstruction of developmental trajectories from {scRNA}-seq data.{RESULTSWe} generated single-cell transcriptomes from 38,731 cells during early zebrafish embryogenesis at high temporal resolution, spanning 12 stages from the onset of zygotic transcription through early somitogenesis. We took two complementary approaches to identify the transcriptional trajectories in the data. First, we developed a simulated diffusion-based computational approach, {URD}, which identified the trajectories describing the specification of 25 cell types in the form of a branching tree. Second, we identified modules of coexpressed genes and connected them across developmental time. Combining the reconstructed developmental trajectories with differential gene expression analysis uncovered gene expression cascades leading to each cell type, including previously unidentified markers and candidate regulators. Combining these trajectories with Seurat, which infers the spatial positions of cells on the basis of their transcriptomes, connected the earlier spatial position of progenitors to the later fate of their descendants.Inspection of the developmental tree led to new insights about molecular specification in zebrafish. For example, the first branch point in the tree indicated that the first molecular specification event may not only separate the germ layers but also define the axial versus nonaxial mesendoderm. Additionally, some developmental branch points contained intermediate cells that expressed genes characteristic of multiple downstream cell fates. Gene expression analysis at one such branch point (the axial mesoderm) suggested that the intermediate cells switch their specification from one fate (notochord) to another (prechordal plate). Last, analysis of single-cell transcriptomes from a Nodal-signaling mutant revealed that even at the whole-transcriptome level, mutant cells were canalized into a subset of wild-type states and did not adopt any transcriptional states not observed in wild type, despite abnormal developmental signaling.{CONCLUSIONThese} findings reconstruct the gene expression trajectories during the embryogenesis of a vertebrate and highlight the concurrent canalization and plasticity of cell type specification. The {scRNA}-seq data and developmental tree provide a rich resource for future studies in zebrafish: The raw and processed data and the {URD} software are available for download, and the data can be browsed interactively online. Last, this approach provides a broadly applicable framework with which to reconstruct complex developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomes.Developmental tree of early zebrafish embryogenesis.Single-cell transcriptomes were generated from zebrafish embryos at 12 developmental stages (six of which are shown). The transcriptional trajectories that describe the fate specification of 25 cell types were reconstructed from the data. Molecular specification is visualized with a force-directed layout, in which each cell is represented by a point (colored by developmental stage), proceeding from pluripotent cells (at the bottom center) outward to 25 distinct cell types. A subset of the identified trajectories are labeled in groups.During embryogenesis, cells acquire distinct fates by transitioning through transcriptional states. To uncover these transcriptional trajectories during zebrafish embryogenesis, we sequenced 38,731 cells and developed {URD}, a simulated diffusion-based computational reconstruction method. {URD} identified the trajectories of 25 cell types through early somitogenesis, gene expression along them, and their spatial origin in the blastula. Analysis of Nodal signaling mutants revealed that their transcriptomes were canalized into a subset of wild-type transcriptional trajectories. Some wild-type developmental branch points contained cells that express genes characteristic of multiple fates. These cells appeared to trans-specify from one fate to another. These findings reconstruct the transcriptional trajectories of a vertebrate embryo, highlight the concurrent canalization and plasticity of embryonic specification, and provide a framework with which to reconstruct complex developmental trees from single-cell transcriptomes.},

	abstract = {Large datasets represented by multidimensional data point clouds often possess non-trivial distributions with branching trajectories and excluded regions, with the recent single-cell transcriptomic studies of developing embryo being notable examples. Reducing the complexity and producing compact and interpretable representations of such data remains a challenging task.

Here we present {ElPiGraph}, a scalable and robust method for approximation of datasets with complex structures which does not require computing the complete data distance matrix or the data point neighbourhood graph. This method is able to withstand high levels of noise and is capable of approximating complex topologies via principal graph ensembles that can be combined into a consensus principal graph. {ElPiGraph} deals efficiently with large and complex datasets in various fields from biology, where it can be used to infer gene dynamics from single-cell {RNA}-Seq, to astronomy, where it can be used to explore complex structures in the distribution of galaxies.},

In certain disciplines, there exist established benchmarks and public resources where experts in a particular methodology are encouraged to supply their most efficient implementation of each particular benchmark. We aim to provide such a resource for protocols in macromolecular modeling and design. We present a freely accessible web resource (https://kortemmelab.ucsf.edu/benchmarks) to guide the development of protocols for protein modeling and design. The site provides benchmark datasets and metrics to compare the performance of a variety of modeling protocols using different computational sampling methods and energy functions, providing a “best practice” set of parameters for each method. Each benchmark has an associated downloadable benchmark capture archive containing the input files, analysis scripts, and tutorials for running the benchmark. The captures may be run with any suitable modeling method; we supply command lines for running the benchmarks using the Rosetta software suite. We have compiled initial benchmarks for the resource spanning three key areas: prediction of energetic effects of mutations, protein design, and protein structure prediction, each with associated state-of-the-art modeling protocols. With the help of the wider macromolecular modeling community, we hope to expand the variety of benchmarks included on the website and continue to evaluate new iterations of current methods as they become available.},

The publication of studies with dissimilar or altogether contradictory results, obtained using different microarray platforms to analyze identical {RNA} samples, has raised concerns about the reliability of this technology. The {MicroArray} Quality Control ({MAQC}) project was initiated to address these concerns, as well as other performance and data analysis issues. Expression data on four titration pools from two distinct reference {RNA} samples were generated at multiple test sites using a variety of microarray-based and alternative technology platforms. Here we describe the experimental design and probe mapping efforts behind the {MAQC} project. We show intraplatform consistency across test sites as well as a high level of interplatform concordance in terms of genes identified as differentially expressed. This study provides a resource that represents an important first step toward establishing a framework for the use of microarrays in clinical and regulatory settings.},

Scientific reproduction of published findings requires running computational tools on data generated by such studies, yet little attention is presently allocated to the installability and archival stability of computational software tools. Scientific journals require data and code sharing, but none currently require authors to guarantee the continuing functionality of newly published tools. We have estimated the archival stability of computational biology software tools by performing an empirical analysis of the internet presence for 36,702 omics software resources published from 2005 to 2017. We found that almost 28\% of all resources are currently not accessible through uniform resource locators ({URLs}) published in the paper they first appeared in. Among the 98 software tools selected for our installability test, 51\% were deemed "easy to install," and 28\% of the tools failed to be installed at all because of problems in the implementation. Moreover, for papers introducing new software, we found that the number of citations significantly increased when authors provided an easy installation process. We propose for incorporation into journal policy several practical solutions for increasing the widespread installability and archival stability of published bioinformatics software.},

While this is straightforward for simple prediction rules, such as those based on the logistic regression model, this is much more difficult for complex prediction rules derived by machine learning tools. We conducted a survey of articles reporting prediction rules that were constructed using the random forest algorithm and published in {PLOS} {ONE} in 2014-2015 in the field "medical and health sciences", with the aim of identifying issues related to their applicability. Making a prediction rule reproducible is a possible way to ensure that it is applicable; thus reproducibility is also examined in our survey. The presented prediction rules were applicable in only 2 of 30 identified papers, while for further eight prediction rules it was possible to obtain the necessary information by contacting the authors. Various problems, such as nonresponse of the authors, hampered the applicability of prediction rules in the other cases. Based on our experiences from this illustrative survey, we formulate a set of recommendations for authors who aim to make complex prediction rules applicable for readers.

In this situation, a natural strategy is to train the model on experimental data from some cell types and evaluate performance on one or more held-out cell types. In this work, we show that, when the training set contains examples derived from the same genomic loci across multiple cell types, then the resulting model can be susceptible to a particular form of bias related to memorizing the average activity associated with each genomic locus. Consequently, the trained model may appear to perform well when evaluated on the genomic loci that it was trained on but tends to perform poorly on loci that it was not trained on. We demonstrate this phenomenon by using epigenomic measurements and nucleotide sequence to predict gene expression and chromatin domain boundaries, and we suggest methods to diagnose and avoid the pitfall. We anticipate that, as more data and computing resources become available, future projects will increasingly risk suffering from this issue.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Another way of dealing with this is to quote two numbers, such as Recall and Precision, or Sensitivity and Specificity. But it can also be useful to see more than this, and a graphical approach can explore sensitivity to cost, prevalence, bias, noise, parameters and hyper-parameters. Moreover, most techniques are implicitly based on two balanced classes, and our ability to visualize graphically is intrinsically two dimensional, but we often want to visualize in a multiclass context. We review the dichotomous approaches relating to Precision, Recall, and {ROC} as well as the related {LIFT} chart, exploring how they handle unbalanced and multiclass data, and deriving new probabilistic and information theoretic variants of {LIFT} that help deal with the issues associated with the handling of multiple and unbalanced classes.},

	issn = {2335-6936},
	abstract = {Single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) is a powerful tool to profile the transcriptomes of a large number of individual cells at a high resolution. These data usually contain measurements of gene expression for many genes in thousands or tens of thousands of cells, though some datasets now reach the million-cell mark. Projecting high-dimensional {scRNA}-seq data into a low dimensional space aids downstream analysis and data visualization. Many recent preprints accomplish this using variational autoencoders ({VAE}), generative models that learn underlying structure of data by compress it into a constrained, low dimensional space. The low dimensional spaces generated by {VAEs} have revealed complex patterns and novel biological signals from large-scale gene expression data and drug response predictions. Here, we evaluate a simple {VAE} approach for gene expression data, Tybalt, by training and measuring its performance on sets of simulated {scRNA}-seq data. We find a number of counter-intuitive performance features: i.e., deeper neural networks can struggle when datasets contain more observations under some parameter configurations. We show that these methods are highly sensitive to parameter tuning: when tuned, the performance of the Tybalt model, which was not optimized for {scRNA}-seq data, outperforms other popular dimension reduction approaches - {PCA}, {ZIFA}, {UMAP} and t-{SNE}. On the other hand, without tuning performance can also be remarkably poor on the same data. Our results should discourage authors and reviewers from relying on self-reported performance comparisons to evaluate the relative value of contributions in this area at this time. Instead, we recommend that attempts to compare or benchmark autoencoder methods for {scRNA}-seq data be performed by disinterested third parties or by methods developers only on unseen benchmark data that are provided to all participants simultaneously because the potential for performance differences due to unequal parameter tuning is so high.},

{METHODS}: 981 cholangitis episodes from 810 patients were analysed retrospectively at a German tertiary center.
{RESULTS}: Out of eleven investigated statistical models fit to 22 predictors, the Random Forest model achieved the best (cross-)validated performance to predict mortality. The receiver operating characteristics ({ROC}) curve revealed a mean area under the curve ({AUC}) of 91.5 \%. Dependent on the calculated mortality risk, we propose to stratify patients with acute cholangitis into a high and low risk group. The mean sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of the corresponding optimal cutpoint were 82.9 \%, 85.1 \%, 19.0 \% and 99.3 \%, respectively. All of these results emerge from nested (cross-)validation and are supposed to reflect the model's performance expected for external data. An implementation of our risk prediction model including the specific treatment recommendations adopted from the Tokyo guidelines is available on http://www2.imse.med.tum.de:3838/ .
{CONCLUSION}: Our risk prediction model for mortality appears promising to stratify patients with acute cholangitis into different management groups. Additional validation of its performance should be provided by further prospective trails.},

In most case studies based on the {BRaliBase} benchmark, one can observe a puzzling drop in accuracy in the 40-60\% sequence identity range, the so-called '{BRaliBase} Dent'. In this article, we show this dent is owing to a bias in the composition of the {BRaliBase} benchmark, namely the inclusion of a disproportionate number of transfer {RNAs}, which exhibit a conserved secondary structure. Our analysis, aside of its interest regarding the specific case of the {BRaliBase} benchmark, also raises important questions regarding the design and use of benchmarks in computational biology.},

We propose an evaluation of the impact of these choices when few biological replicates are available through the use of synthetic data sets. This framework is based on real data sets and allows the exploration of various scenarios differing in the proportion of non-differentially expressed genes. Hence, it provides an evaluation of the key ingredients of the differential analysis, free of the biases associated with the simulation of data using parametric models. Our results show the relevance of a proper modeling of the mean by using linear or generalized linear modeling. Once the mean is properly modeled, the impact of the other parameters on the performance of the test is much less important. Finally, we propose to use the simple visualization of the raw P-value histogram as a practical evaluation criterion of the performance of differential analysis methods on real data sets.},

Imprinting has been tied to the evolution of the placenta in mammals and defects of imprinting have been associated with human diseases. Although recent advances in genome sequencing have revolutionized the study of {DNA} methylation, existing methylome data remain largely untapped in the study of imprinting. We present a statistical model to describe allele-specific methylation ({ASM}) in data from high-throughput short-read bisulfite sequencing. Simulation results indicate technical specifications of existing methylome data, such as read length and coverage, are sufficient for full-genome {ASM} profiling based on our model. We used our model to analyze methylomes for a diverse set of human cell types, including cultured and uncultured differentiated cells, embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells. Regions of {ASM} identified most consistently across methylomes are tightly connected with known imprinted genes and precisely delineate the boundaries of several known imprinting control regions. Predicted regions of {ASM} common to multiple cell types frequently mark noncoding {RNA} promoters and represent promising starting points for targeted validation. More generally, our model provides the analytical complement to cutting-edge experimental technologies for surveying {ASM} in specific cell types and across species.},

Alternative measures such as positive predictive value ({PPV}) and the associated Precision/Recall ({PRC}) plots are used less frequently. Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While {ROC} plots are visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier's performance across a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether {ROC} plots could be misleading when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual interpretability of {ROC} plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. {PRC} plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation of a large number of studies that use {ROC} plots on imbalanced datasets.},

This allowed us to objectively evaluate the performance of all tools on all data sets with up to 1,000 different parameter sets each, resulting in a total of more than 4 million calculated cluster validity indices. We observed that there was no universal best performer, but on the basis of this wide-ranging comparison we were able to develop a short guideline for biomedical clustering tasks. {ClustEval} allows biomedical researchers to pick the appropriate tool for their data type and allows method developers to compare their tool to the state of the art.},

And yet, scant attention has been paid to comparative assessments of these assemblers' quality and accuracy. No commonly accepted and standardized method for comparison exists yet. Even worse, widely used metrics to compare the assembled sequences emphasize only size, poorly capturing the contig quality and accuracy. This paper addresses these concerns: it highlights common anomalies in assembly accuracy through a rigorous study of several assemblers, compared under both standard metrics (N50, coverage, contig sizes, etc.) as well as a more comprehensive metric (Feature-Response Curves, {FRC}) that is introduced here; {FRC} transparently captures the trade-offs between contigs' quality against their sizes. For this purpose, most of the publicly available major sequence assemblers--both for low-coverage long (Sanger) and high-coverage short (Illumina) reads technologies--are compared. These assemblers are applied to microbial (Escherichia coli, Brucella, Wolbachia, Staphylococcus, Helicobacter) and partial human genome sequences (Chr. Y), using sequence reads of various read-lengths, coverages, accuracies, and with and without mate-pairs. It is hoped that, based on these evaluations, computational biologists will identify innovative sequence assembly paradigms, bioinformaticists will determine promising approaches for developing "next-generation" assemblers, and biotechnologists will formulate more meaningful design desiderata for sequencing technology platforms. A new software tool for computing the {FRC} metric has been developed and is available through the {AMOS} open-source consortium.},

Many transcriptomic studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or transcripts. Various quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential gene expression analyses on simple count matrices but that this can be addressed by incorporating offsets derived from transcript-level abundance estimates. We also show that the problem is relatively minor in several real data sets. Finally, we provide an R package (

	abstract = {In recent years in the fields of statistics and machine learning an increasing amount of so called local classification methods has been developed. Local approaches to classification are not new, but have lately become popular. Well-known examples are the 𝑘kk nearest neighbors method and classification trees. However, in most publications on this topic the term “local” is used without further explanation of its particular meaning. Only little is known about the properties of local methods and the types of classification problems for which they may be beneficial. We explain the basic principles and introduce the most important variants of local methods. To our knowledge there are very few extensive studies in the literature that compare several types of local methods and global methods across many data sets.

	doi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btk046},
	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: In the Affymetrix {GeneChip} system, preprocessing occurs before one obtains expression level measurements. Because the number of competing preprocessing methods was large and growing we developed a benchmark to help users identify the best method for their application. A webtool was made available for developers to benchmark their procedures. At the time of writing over 50 methods had been submitted.
{RESULTS}: We benchmarked 31 probe set algorithms using a U95A dataset of spike in controls. Using this dataset, we found that background correction, one of the main steps in preprocessing, has the largest effect on performance. In particular, background correction appears to improve accuracy but, in general, worsen precision. The benchmark results put this balance in perspective. Furthermore, we have improved some of the original benchmark metrics to provide more detailed information regarding precision and accuracy. A handful of methods stand out as providing the best balance using spike-in data with the older U95A array, although different experiments on more current arrays may benchmark differently.
{AVAILABILITY}: The affycomp package, now version 1.5.2, continues to be available as part of the Bioconductor project (http://www.bioconductor.org). The webtool continues to be available at http://affycomp.biostat.jhsph.edu

This is a bonanza for the statistical geneticist, who can create probeset summaries with specific characteristics. There are now several methods available for summarizing probe level data from the popular Affymetrix {GeneChips}, but it is difficult to identify the best method for a given inquiry.
{RESULTS}: We have developed a graphical tool to evaluate summaries of Affymetrix probe level data. Plots and summary statistics offer a picture of how an expression measure performs in several important areas. This picture facilitates the comparison of competing expression measures and the selection of methods suitable for a specific investigation. The key is a benchmark data set consisting of a dilution study and a spike-in study. Because the truth is known for these data, we can identify statistical features of the data for which the expected outcome is known in advance. Those features highlighted in our suite of graphs are justified by questions of biological interest and motivated by the presence of appropriate data.},

Hence, results can be verified and researchers are able to build upon these. Efforts of the Biometrical Journal over the last five years have increased the number of manuscripts which are reproducible by a factor of 4 to almost 50\%. Yet, more than half of the code submission could not be executed in the initial review due to missing code, missing data or errors in the code. Careful checks of the submitted code as part of the reviewing process are essential to eliminate these issues and to foster {RR}. In this article, we reviewed n=56 recent submissions of code and data to identify common reproducibility issues. Based on these findings, guidelines for structuring code submission to the Biometrical Journal have been established to help authors. These guidelines should help researchers to implement {RR} in general. Together with the code reviews, this supports the mission of the Biometrical Journal in publishing highest quality, novel and relevant papers on statistical methods and their applications in life sciences.

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

	abstract = {A central tenet of reproducible research is that scientific results are published along with the underlying data and software code necessary to reproduce and verify the findings. A host of tools and software have been released that facilitate such work-flows and scientific journals have increasingly demanded that code and primary data be made available with publications. There has been little practical advice on implementing reproducible research work-flows for large 'omics' or systems biology data sets used by teams of analysts working in collaboration. In such instances it is important to ensure all analysts use the same version of a data set for their analyses. Yet, instantiating relational databases and standard operating procedures can be unwieldy, with high "startup" costs and poor adherence to procedures when they deviate substantially from an analyst's usual work-flow. Ideally a reproducible research work-flow should fit naturally into an individual's existing work-flow, with minimal disruption. Here, we provide an overview of how we have leveraged popular open source tools, including Bioconductor, Rmarkdown, git version control, R, and specifically R's package system combined with a new tool {DataPackageR}, to implement a lightweight reproducible research work-flow for preprocessing large data sets, suitable for sharing among small-to-medium sized teams of computational scientists. Our primary contribution is the {DataPackageR} tool, which decouples time-consuming data processing from data analysis while leaving a traceable record of how raw data is processed into analysis-ready data sets. The software ensures packaged data objects are properly documented and performs checksum verification of these along with basic package version management, and importantly, leaves a record of data processing code in the form of package vignettes. Our group has implemented this work-flow to manage, analyze and report on pre-clinical immunological trial data from multi-center, multi-assay studies for the past three years.},

	abstract = {With recent advances in sequencing technology, it is now feasible to measure {DNA} methylation at tens of millions of sites across the entire genome. In most applications, biologists are interested in detecting differentially methylated regions, composed of multiple sites with differing methylation levels among populations. However, current computational approaches for detecting such regions do not provide accurate statistical inference. A major challenge in reporting uncertainty is that a genome-wide scan is involved in detecting these regions, which needs to be accounted for. A further challenge is that sample sizes are limited due to the costs associated with the technology. We have developed a new approach that overcomes these challenges and assesses uncertainty for differentially methylated regions in a rigorous manner. Region-level statistics are obtained by fitting a generalized least squares regression model with a nested autoregressive correlated error structure for the effect of interest on transformed methylation proportions. We develop an inferential approach, based on a pooled null distribution, that can be implemented even when as few as two samples per population are available. Here, we demonstrate the advantages of our method using both experimental data and Monte Carlo simulation. We find that the new method improves the specificity and sensitivity of lists of regions and accurately controls the false discovery rate.},

This means that proposals of new methods of data pre-processing, new data-analytic techniques, and new methods of output post-processing, should be extensively and carefully compared with existing alternatives, and that existing methods should be subjected to neutral comparison studies. To date, benchmarking and recommendations for benchmarking have been frequently seen in the context of supervised learning. Unfortunately, there has been a dearth of guidelines for benchmarking in an unsupervised setting, with the area of clustering as an important subdomain. To address this problem, discussion is given to the theoretical conceptual underpinnings of benchmarking in the field of cluster analysis by means of simulated as well as empirical data. Subsequently, the practicalities of how to address benchmarking questions in clustering are dealt with, and foundational recommendations are made.},

This implies that useful bioinformatics software is not only the domain of famous senior researchers. In addition, we found that there exists an excess of slow and inaccurate software tools across multiple sub-disciplines of bioinformatics. Meanwhile, there are very few tools of middling accuracy and speed. We hypothesise that a strong publication bias unduly influences the publication and development of bioinformatic software tools. In other words, at present software that is not highly ranked on speed and not highly ranked on accuracy is difficult to publish due to editorial and reviewer practices. This leaves an unfortunate gap in the literature upon which future software refinements cannot be constructed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, these claims are often not based on proper statistical tests and, even if such tests are performed, the tested hypothesis is not clearly defined and poor attention is devoted to the Type I and Type {II} errors. In the present article, we aim to fill this gap by providing a proper statistical framework for hypothesis tests that compare the performances of supervised learning methods based on several real datasets with unknown underlying distributions. After giving a statistical interpretation of ad hoc tests commonly performed by computational researchers, we devote special attention to power issues and outline a simple method of determining the number of datasets to be included in a comparison study to reach an adequate power. These methods are illustrated through three comparison studies from the literature and an exemplary benchmarking study using gene expression microarray data.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The goal of medical research is to develop interventions that are in some sense superior, with respect to patient outcome, to interventions currently in use. Similarly, the goal of research in methodological computational statistics is to develop data analysis tools that are themselves superior to the existing tools. The methodology of the evaluation of medical interventions continues to be discussed extensively in the literature and it is now well accepted that medicine should be at least partly "evidence-based". Although we statisticians are convinced of the importance of unbiased, well-thought-out study designs and evidence-based approaches in the context of clinical research, we tend to ignore these principles when designing our own studies for evaluating statistical methods in the context of our methodological research.
{MAIN} {MESSAGE}: In this paper, we draw an analogy between clinical trials and real-data-based benchmarking experiments in methodological statistical science, with datasets playing the role of patients and methods playing the role of medical interventions. Through this analogy, we suggest directions for improvement in the design and interpretation of studies which use real data to evaluate statistical methods, in particular with respect to dataset inclusion criteria and the reduction of various forms of bias. More generally, we discuss the concept of "evidence-based" statistical research, its limitations and its impact on the design and interpretation of real-data-based benchmark experiments.
{CONCLUSION}: We suggest that benchmark studies-a method of assessment of statistical methods using real-world datasets-might benefit from adopting (some) concepts from evidence-based medicine towards the goal of more evidence-based statistical research.},

	abstract = {{MOTIVATION}: The proliferation of public data repositories creates a need for meta-analysis methods to efficiently evaluate, integrate and validate related datasets produced by independent groups. A t-based approach has been proposed to integrate effect size from multiple studies by modeling both intra- and between-study variation. Recently, a non-parametric 'rank product' method, which is derived based on biological reasoning of fold-change criteria, has been applied to directly combine multiple datasets into one meta study. Fisher's Inverse chi(2) method, which only depends on P-values from individual analyses of each dataset, has been used in a couple of medical studies. While these methods address the question from different angles, it is not clear how they compare with each other.
{RESULTS}: We comparatively evaluate the three methods; t-based hierarchical modeling, rank products and Fisher's Inverse chi(2) test with P-values from either the t-based or the rank product method. A simulation study shows that the rank product method, in general, has higher sensitivity and selectivity than the t-based method in both individual and meta-analysis, especially in the setting of small sample size and/or large between-study variation. Not surprisingly, Fisher's chi(2) method highly depends on the method used in the individual analysis. Application to real datasets demonstrates that meta-analysis achieves more reliable identification than an individual analysis, and rank products are more robust in gene ranking, which leads to a much higher reproducibility among independent studies. Though t-based meta-analysis greatly improves over the individual analysis, it suffers from a potentially large amount of false positives when P-values serve as threshold. We conclude that careful meta-analysis is a powerful tool for integrating multiple array studies.},

	abstract = {Isogenic cells in a common environment present a large degree of heterogeneity in gene expression. Part of this variability is attributed to transcriptional bursting: the stochastic activation and inactivation of promoters that leads to the discontinuous production of {mRNA}. The diversity in bursting patterns displayed by different genes suggests the existence of a connection between bursting and gene regulation. Experimental strategies such as single-molecule {RNA} {FISH}, {MS}2-{GFP} or short-lived protein reporters allow the quantification of transcriptional bursting and the comparison of bursting kinetics between conditions, allowing therefore the identification of molecular mechanisms modulating transcriptional bursting. In this review we recapitulate the impact on transcriptional bursting of different molecular aspects of transcription such as the chromatin environment, nucleosome occupancy, histone modifications, the number and affinity of regulatory elements, {DNA} looping and transcription factor availability. More specifically, we examine their role in tuning the burst size or the burst frequency. While some molecular mechanisms involved in transcription such as histone marks can affect every aspect of bursting, others predominantly influence the burst size (e.g. the number and affinity of cis-regulatory elements) or frequency (e.g. transcription factor availability).},

These single-cell analyses will allow researchers to uncover new and potentially unexpected biological discoveries relative to traditional profiling methods that assess bulk populations.

Here, we provide a comprehensive review of a number of (semi-) automated {FISH} and {IHC} image processing systems, focusing on the algorithmic aspects of each technique. Our review verifies the increasingly important role of such methods in {FISH} and {IHC}; however, manual intervention is still necessary in order to resolve particularly challenging or ambiguous cases.

The power of multiplexing combined with spatial information and quantification was recently illustrated on breast cancer tissue and was described as next-generation {IHC}. Robust, accurate, and high-throughput cell segmentation is crucial for the analysis of this new generation of {IHC} data. To this end, we propose a watershed-based cell segmentation, which uses a nuclear marker and multiple membrane markers, the latter automatically selected based on their correlation. In comparison with the state-of-the-art segmentation pipelines, which are only using a single marker for object detection, we could show that the use of multiple markers can significantly increase the segmentation power, and thus, multiplexed information should be used and not ignored during the segmentation. Furthermore, we provide a novel, user-friendly open-source toolbox for the automatic segmentation of multiplexed histopathological images. ? 2015 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

This combination of technical assets has powered a series of recent cytomic studies where investigators used mass cytometry to measure protein and phospho-protein expression in millions of cells, characterize rare cell types in healthy and diseased tissues, and reveal novel, unexpected cells. However, these advances largely occurred in studies of blood, lymphoid tissues, and bone marrow, since the cells in these tissues are readily obtained in single-cell suspensions. This unit establishes a primer for single-cell analysis of solid tumors and tissues, and has been tested with mass cytometry. The cells obtained from these protocols can be fixed for study, cryopreserved for long-term storage, or perturbed ex vivo to dissect responses to stimuli and inhibitors. ? 2017 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {Choice of a T lymphoid fate by hematopoietic progenitor cells depends on sustained Notch–Delta signaling combined with tightly regulated activities of multiple transcription factors. To dissect the regulatory network connections that mediate this process, we have used high-resolution analysis of regulatory gene expression trajectories from the beginning to the end of specification, tests of the short-term Notch dependence of these gene expression changes, and analyses of the effects of overexpression of two essential transcription factors, namely {PU}.1 and {GATA}-3. Quantitative expression measurements of \&gt;50 transcription factor and marker genes have been used to derive the principal components of regulatory change through which T cell precursors progress from primitive multipotency to T lineage commitment. Our analyses reveal separate contributions of Notch signaling, {GATA}-3 activity, and down-regulation of {PU}.1. Using {BioTapestry} (www.{BioTapestry}.org), the results have been assembled into a draft gene regulatory network for the specification of T cell precursors and the choice of T as opposed to myeloid/dendritic or mast-cell fates. This network also accommodates effects of E proteins and mutual repression circuits of Gfi1 against Egr-2 and of {TCF}-1 against {PU}.1 as proposed elsewhere, but requires additional functions that remain unidentified. Distinctive features of this network structure include the intense dose dependence of {GATA}-3 effects, the gene-specific modulation of {PU}.1 activity based on Notch activity, the lack of direct opposition between {PU}.1 and {GATA}-3, and the need for a distinct, late-acting repressive function or functions to extinguish stem and progenitor-derived regulatory gene expression.},

Though the development of single cell assays allows for the capture of progenitor cell states in great detail, these assays cannot definitively link cell states to their long-term fate. Here, we use expressed {DNA} barcodes to clonally trace single cell transcriptomes dynamically during differentiation and apply this approach to the study of hematopoiesis. Our analysis identifies functional boundaries of cell potential early in the hematopoietic hierarchy and locates them on a continuous transcriptional landscape. We reconstruct a developmental hierarchy showing separate ontogenies for granulocytic subtypes and two routes to monocyte differentiation that leave a persistent imprint on mature cells. Finally, we use our approach to benchmark methods of dynamic inference from single-cell snapshots, and provide evidence of strong early fate biases dependent on cellular properties hidden from single-cell {RNA} sequencing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, the intermediate stages through which individual cells progress during reprogramming are largely undefined. Here we use single-cell {RNA} sequencing at multiple time points to dissect direct reprogramming from mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced neuronal cells. By deconstructing heterogeneity at each time point and ordering cells by transcriptome similarity, we find that the molecular reprogramming path is remarkably continuous. Overexpression of the proneural pioneer factor Ascl1 results in a well-defined initialization, causing cells to exit the cell cycle and re-focus gene expression through distinct neural transcription factors. The initial transcriptional response is relatively homogeneous among fibroblasts, suggesting that the early steps are not limiting for productive reprogramming. Instead, the later emergence of a competing myogenic program and variable transgene dynamics over time appear to be the major efficiency limits of direct reprogramming. Moreover, a transcriptional state, distinct from donor and target cell programs, is transiently induced in cells undergoing productive reprogramming. Our data provide a high-resolution approach for understanding transcriptome states during lineage differentiation.},

Applying this method to primary human myoblasts, we not only identified three known cell types but also estimated both their fate probabilities and transition probabilities among them. We found that the percent of the genes expressed in a bursty manner is significantly higher at the branch point than before or after branch, and there are apparent changes in both gene-gene and cell-cell correlations before and after branch. In general, single-cell transcriptome data with Topographer can well reveal the stochastic mechanisms of cell fate decisions from three different levels: cell lineage (macroscopic), gene network (mesoscopic) and gene expression (microscopic).},

	doi = {10.1101/167684},
	abstract = {During embryonic development, cells undertake a series of cell fate decisions to form a complete organism, epitomising a branching process. In some instances, these decisions are reversible, particularly during the onset of disease, exemplifying a recombination process. Single cell transcriptomics provides a rich resource to explore the temporal progression of bifurcations in gene activity, useful to elucidate the mechanisms of cell fate decisions. However, identification of transcriptional branching or recombination poses a major statistical challenge. Here, we have developed a comprehensive nonparametric Bayesian approach to the inference of branching and recombination, in the form of branch-recombinant Gaussian Processes (B-{RGPs}). We use B-{RGPs} to infer transcriptional branching that occurs during early human development as primordial germ cells ({PGCs}), the precursors of sperm and egg, are specified in the developing embryo. Using our approach, we identify known master regulators of human {PGC} development, and predict roles for a variety of signalling pathways, as well as transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers. By concentrating on the earliest branched signalling events, we identified an antagonistic role for {FGF} receptor ({FGFR}) signalling pathway in the acquisition of competence for human {PGC} fate. Indeed, the experimental validation of our prediction confirmed that pharmacological blocking of {FGFR} or its downstream effectors ({MEK}, {PI}3K and {JAK}) enhanced the competency for {PGC} fate in vitro. Thus, B-{RGPs} represent a powerful and flexible data-driven approach for dissecting the temporal dynamics of cell fate decisions, providing unique insights into the mechanisms of early embryogenesis.},

	abstract = {Measurement of gene expression levels for multiple genes in single cells provides a powerful approach to study heterogeneity of cell populations and cellular plasticity. While the expression levels of multiple genes in each cell are available in such data, the potential connections among the cells (e.g. the cellular state transition relationship) are not directly evident from the measurement. Classifying the cellular states, identifying their transitions among those states, and extracting the pseudotime ordering of cells are challenging due to the noise in the data and the high-dimensionality in the number of genes in the data. In this paper we adapt the classical self-organizing-map ({SOM}) approach for single-cell gene expression data ({SOMSC}), such as those based on single cell {qPCR} and single cell {RNA}-seq. In {SOMSC}, a cellular state map ({CSM}) is derived and employed to identify cellular states inherited in the population of the measured single cells. Cells located in the same basin of the {CSM} are considered as in one cellular state while barriers among the basins in {CSM} provide information on transitions among the cellular states. A cellular state transitions path (e.g. differentiation) and a temporal ordering of the measured single cells are consequently obtained. In addition, {SOMSC} could estimate the cellular state replication probability and transition probabilities. Applied to a set of synthetic data, one single-cell {qPCR} data set on mouse early embryonic development and two single-cell {RNA}-seq data sets, {SOMSC} shows effectiveness in capturing cellular states and their transitions presented in the high-dimensional single-cell data. This approach will have broader applications to analyzing cellular fate specification and cell lineages using single cell gene expression data.},

Lönnberg et al. use single-cell transcriptomics and computational modeling to delineate the molecular cues that guide this decision. During blood-stage Plasmodium infection in mice, the authors track {TH}1/{TFH} bifurcation at both the population and single-clone levels and identify genes associated with each path. They demonstrate roles of particular cell types in shaping this decision. This approach provides a broad framework for modeling immune cell differentiation in vivo. Differentiation of naïve {CD}4+ T cells into functionally distinct T helper ({TH}) subsets is crucial for the orchestration of immune responses. Because of extensive heterogeneity and multiple overlapping transcriptional programs in differentiating T cell populations, this process has remained a challenge for systematic dissection in vivo. By using single-cell transcriptomics and computational analysis with a temporal mixtures of Gaussian processes model, termed {GPfates}, we reconstructed the developmental trajectories of {TH}1 and {TFH} (T follicular helper) cells during blood-stage Plasmodium infection in mice. By tracking clonality using endogenous T cell receptor sequences, we first demonstrated that {TH}1/{TFH} bifurcation had occurred at both population and single-clone levels. Next, we identified genes whose expression was associated with {TH}1 or {TFH} fates and demonstrated a T cell\${\textbackslash}backslash\$textendash\{\}intrinsic role for Galectin-1 in supporting {TH}1 differentiation. We also revealed the close molecular relationship between {TH}1 and interleukin-10\${\textbackslash}backslash\$textendash\{\}producing Tr1 cells in this infection. {TH}1 and {TFH} fates emerged from a highly proliferative precursor that up-regulated aerobic glycolysis and accelerated cell cycling as cytokine expression began. Dynamic gene expression of chemokine receptors around bifurcation predicted roles for cell-cell interaction in driving {TH}1/{TFH} fates. In particular, we found that precursor {TH} cells were coached toward a {TH}1 but not a {TFH} fate by inflammatory monocytes. Thus, by integrating genomic and computational approaches, our study has provided two unique resources: a database, www.{PlasmoTH}.org, which facilitates discovery of novel factors controlling {TH}1/{TFH} fate commitment, and, more generally, {GPfates}, a modeling framework for characterizing cell differentiation toward multiple fates.

Through exploiting high resolution single cell transcription experiments we show that cells can be located on a landscape that reflects their differentiated nature. Our approach makes use of probabilistic non-linear dimensionality reduction that respects the topology of our estimated epigenetic landscape. In simulation studies and analyses of real data we show that the approach, known as topslam, outperforms previous attempts to understand the differentiation landscape. Hereby, the novelty of our approach lies in the correction of distances before extracting ordering information. This gives the advantage over other attempts, which have to correct for extracted time lines by post processing or additional data.},

Recent advances in single cell transcriptomics suggest an alternative description of development, in which cells follow continuous transcriptomic trajectories. A cell’s state along such a trajectory can be captured with pseudotemporal ordering, which however is not able to predict development of the system in real time. We present pseudodynamics, a mathematical framework that integrates time-series and genetic knock-out information with such transcriptome-based descriptions in order to describe and analyze the real-time evolution of the system. Pseudodynamics models the distribution of a cell population across a continuous cell state coordinate over time based on a stochastic differential equation along developmental trajectories and random switching between trajectories in branching regions. To illustrate feasibility, we use pseudodynamics to estimate cell-state-dependent growth and differentiation of thymic T-cell development. The model approximates a developmental potential function (Waddington’s landscape) and suggests that thymic T-cell development is biphasic and not strictly deterministic before beta-selection. Pseudodynamics generalizes classical discrete population models to continuous states and thus opens possibilities such as probabilistic model selection to single cell genomics.},

The growth plate ({GP}) comprising sequentially differentiated cell layers is a critical structure for bone elongation and regeneration. Although several key regulators in {GP} development have been identified using genetic perturbation, systematic understanding is still limited. Here, we used single-cell {RNA}-sequencing ({RNA}-seq) to determine the gene expression profiles of 217 single cells from {GPs} and developed a bioinformatics pipeline named Sinova to de novo reconstruct physiological {GP} development in both temporal and spatial high resolution. Our unsupervised model not only confirmed prior knowledge, but also enabled the systematic discovery of genes, potential signal pathways, and surface markers {CD}9/{CD}200 to precisely depict development. Sinova further identified the effective combination of transcriptional factors ({TFs}) that regulates {GP} maturation, and the result was validated using an in vitro {EGFP}-Col10a screening system. Our case systematically reconstructed molecular cascades in {GP} development through single-cell profiling, and the bioinformatics pipeline is applicable to other developmental processes.

	abstract = {Recent high-dimensional single-cell technologies such as mass cytometry are enabling time series experiments to monitor the temporal evolution of cell state distributions and to identify dynamically important cell states, such as fate decision states in differentiation. However, these technologies are destructive, and require analysis approaches that temporally map between cell state distributions across time points. Current approaches to approximate the single-cell time series as a dynamical system suffer from too restrictive assumptions about the type of kinetics, or link together pairs of sequential measurements in a discontinuous fashion.We propose Dynamic Distribution Decomposition ({DDD}), an operator approximation approach to infer a continuous distribution map between time points. On the basis of single-cell snapshot time series data, {DDD} approximates the continuous time Perron-Frobenius operator by means of a finite set of basis functions. This procedure can be interpreted as a continuous time Markov chain over a continuum of states. By only assuming a memoryless Markov (autonomous) process, the types of dynamics represented are more general than those represented by other common models, e.g., chemical reaction networks, stochastic differential equations. Additionally, the continuity assumption ensures that the same dynamical system maps between all time points, not arbitrarily changing at each time point. We demonstrate the ability of {DDD} to reconstruct dynamically important cell states and their transitions both on synthetic data, as well as on mass cytometry time series of {iPSC} reprogramming of a fibroblast system. We use {DDD} to find previously identified subpopulations of cells and to visualize differentiation trajectories.Dynamic Distribution Decomposition allows interpreting high-dimensional snapshot time series data as a low-dimensional Markov process, thereby enabling an interpretable dynamics analysis for a variety of biological processes by means of identifying their dynamically important cell states.Author summary High-dimensional single-cell snapshot measurements are now increasingly utilized to study dynamic processes. Such measurements enable us to evaluate cell population distributions and their evolution over time. However, it is not trivial to map these distribution across time and to identify dynamically important cell states, i.e. bottleneck regions of state space exhibiting a high degree of change. We present Dynamic Distribution Decomposition ({DDD}) achieving this task by encoding single-cell measurements as linear combination of basis function distributions and evolving these as a linear system. We demonstrate reconstruction of dynamically important states for synthetic data of a bifurcated diffusion process and mass cytometry data for {iPSC} reprogramming.},

Understanding the molecular programs that guide differentiation during development is a major challenge.

We apply the method to reconstruct the landscape of reprogramming from 315,000 single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({scRNA}-seq) profiles, collected at half-day intervals across 18 days. The results reveal a wider range of developmental programs than previously characterized. Cells gradually adopt either a terminal stromal state or a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition state. The latter gives rise to populations related to pluripotent, extra-embryonic, and neural cells, with each harboring multiple finer subpopulations. The analysis predicts transcription factors and paracrine signals that affect fates and experiments validate that the {TF} Obox6 and the cytokine {GDF}9 enhance reprogramming efficiency. Our approach sheds light on the process and outcome of reprogramming and provides a framework applicable to diverse temporal processes in biology.},

Here, we present similarity matrix-based optimization for single-cell data analysis ({SoptSC}), in which unsupervised clustering, pseudotemporal ordering, lineage inference, and marker gene identification are inferred via a structured cell-to-cell similarity matrix. {SoptSC} then predicts cell–cell communication networks, enabling reconstruction of complex cell lineages that include feedback or feedforward interactions. Application of {SoptSC} to early embryonic development, epidermal regeneration, and hematopoiesis demonstrates robust identification of subpopulations, lineage relationships, and pseudotime, and prediction of pathway-specific cell communication patterns regulating processes of development and differentiation.},

However, computational tools that can infer developmental cell-state transitions reproducibly from such single-cell data are lacking. Here, we introduce p-Creode, an unsupervised algorithm that produces multi-branching graphs from single-cell data, compares graphs with differing topologies, and infers a statistically robust hierarchy of cell-state transitions that define developmental trajectories. We have applied p-Creode to mass cytometry, multiplex immunofluorescence, and single-cell {RNA}-seq data. As a test case, we validate cell-state-transition trajectories predicted by p-Creode for intestinal tuft cells, a rare, chemosensory cell type. We clarify that tuft cells are specified outside of the \${\textbackslash}backslash\$emph\{Atoh1\}-dependent secretory lineage in the small intestine. However, p-Creode also predicts, and we confirm, that tuft cells arise from an alternative, \${\textbackslash}backslash\$emph\{Atoh1\}-driven developmental program in the colon.

A variety of upstream genetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia ({AML}) lead to overexpression of {HOXA}9, which is a strong predictor of poor prognosis. In many cases, {HOXA}9 has been shown to be necessary for maintaining leukemic transformation, however the molecular mechanisms through which it promotes leukemogenesis remain elusive. Recent work has established that {HOXA}9 regulates downstream gene expression through binding at promoter distal enhancers along with a subset of cell-specific cofactor and collaborator proteins. Increasing efforts are being made to identify both the critical cofactors and target genes required for maintaining transformation in {HOXA}9-overexpressing leukemias. With continued advances in understanding {HOXA}9-mediated transformation, there is a wealth of opportunity for developing novel therapeutics that would be applicable for the greater than 50\% of {AML} with overexpression of {HOXA}9.},

	abstract = {The homeodomain transcription factor {HoxA}10 is maximally expressed in
 myeloid progenitor cells. Sustained {HoxA}10 expression during differentiation
 has been described in poor prognosis human acute myeloid leukemia ({AML}).
 Consistent with this, engineered overexpression of {HoxA}10 in murine bone
 marrow induces a myeloproliferative disorder that progresses to {AML} over time.
 This murine model suggests that {HoxA}10 overexpression is sufficient for
 myeloproliferation but that differentiation block, and therefore {AML}, requires
 acquisition of additional mutations. In myeloid progenitor cells, {HoxA}10
 represses transcription of genes that encode phagocyte effector proteins such
 as gp91PHOX and p67PHOX. Tyrosine phosphorylation of
 {HoxA}10 during myelopoiesis decreases binding to these target genes. In
 immature myeloid cells, {HoxA}10 also activates transcription of the
 {DUSP}4 gene that encodes Mkp2, an anti-apoptotic protein. {HoxA}10
 binding to the {DUSP}4 promoter decreases during myelopoiesis.
 Therefore, both myeloid-specific gene repression and {DUSP}4 activation
 by {HoxA}10 decrease during myelopoiesis. This results in phenotypic
 differentiation and facilitates apoptosis as differentiation proceeds. {HoxA}10
 is de-phosphorylated by {SHP}2 protein-tyrosine phosphatase in myeloid
 progenitors. This mechanism maintains {HoxA}10 in a nonphosphorylated state in
 immature, but not differentiating, myeloid cells. Constitutively active {SHP}2
 mutants have been described in human {AML}, which dephosphorylate {HoxA}10
 throughout myelopoiesis. In this study, we hypothesize that constitutive {SHP}2
 activation synergizes with {HoxA}10 overexpression to accelerate progression to
 {AML}. Because both {HoxA}10 overexpression and constitutive {SHP}2 activation are
 found in poor prognosis human {AML}, these studies contribute to understanding
 biochemical aspects of disease progression in myeloid malignancy.},

To systematically evaluate their associations with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ({ALL}), we examined the three functional single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) rs2227956 (T493M) in {HSPA}1L, rs1043618 in {HSPA}1A 5'{UTR}, and rs1061581 (Q351Q) in {HSPA}1B by {TaqMan} assays or polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism in 114 {ALL} cases and 414 controls from Wales ({UK}), in 100 Mexican Mestizo {ALL} cases and 253 controls belonging to the same ethnic group, and in a panel of 82 {HLA}-typed reference cell line samples. Homozygosity for {HSPA}1B rs1061581 minor allele G was associated with protection (odds ratio ({OR}) = 0.37, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) = 0.16-0.78; P = 0.007) with gene-dosage effect (additive model) reaching significance (P = 0.0001) in the Welsh case-control group. This association was replicated in the second case-control group from Mexico ({OR} (recessive model) = 0.49, 95\% {CI} = 0.24-0.96; P = 0.03), and the pooled analysis yielded a strong association (Mantel-Haenszel {OR} = 0.43, 95\% {CI} = 0.27-0.69, P = 0.0004). The association was stronger in males in each group and in the pooled analysis. A three-{SNP} haplotype including the major allele A of rs1061581 showed a highly significant increase in Welsh cases compared with respective controls (6.7\% vs 1.8\%; P = 0.0003) due to the difference between male cases and controls. The protective allele of rs1061581 occurred more frequently on the {HLA}-{DRB}3 haplotypes (especially {DRB}1*03) in the cell line panel, but the {HSPA}1B association was independent from the {HLA}-{DRB}4 association previously detected in the same case-control group from Wales (adjusted P = 0.001). Given the cancer promoting roles played by {HSPs} intracellularly as well as roles in immune surveillance when expressed on the cell surface and the known correlations between expression levels and the {HSP} polymorphisms, these results are likely to indicate a primary association and warrant detailed assessment in childhood {ALL} development.},

	abstract = {The {DNA}-binding zinc finger transcription factors Gfi1 and Gfi1b were discovered more than 20 years ago and are recognized today as major regulators of both early hematopoiesis and hematopoietic stem cells. Both proteins function as transcriptional repressors by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes to promoters and enhancers of target genes. The establishment of Gfi1 and Gfi1b reporter mice made it possible to visualize their cell type-specific expression and to understand their function in hematopoietic lineages. We now know that Gfi1 is primarily important in myeloid and lymphoid differentiation, whereas Gfi1b is crucial for the generation of red blood cells and platelets. Several rare hematologic diseases are associated with acquired or inheritable mutations in the {GFI}1 and {GFI}1B genes. Certain patients with severe congenital neutropenia carry mutations in the {GFI}1 gene that lead to the disruption of the C-terminal zinc finger domains. Other mutations have been found in the {GFI}1B gene in families with inherited bleeding disorders. In addition, the Gfi1 locus is frequently found to be a proviral integration site in retrovirus-induced lymphomagenesis, and new, emerging data suggest a role of Gfi1 in human leukemia and lymphoma, underlining the role of both factors not only in normal hematopoiesis, but also in a wide spectrum of human blood diseases.},

The number of functionally unclassified proteins is large even for simple and well studied organisms such as baker's yeast. Methods for determining protein function have shifted their focus from targeting specific proteins based solely on sequence homology to analyses of the entire proteome based on protein-protein interaction ({PPI}) networks. Since proteins interact to perform a certain function, analyzing structural properties of {PPI} networks may provide useful clues about the biological function of individual proteins, protein complexes they participate in, and even larger subcellular machines.{ResultsWe} design a sensitive graph theoretic method for comparing local structures of node neighborhoods that demonstrates that in {PPI} networks, biological function of a node and its local network structure are closely related. The method summarizes a protein's local topology in a {PPI} network into the vector of graphlet degrees called the signature of the protein and computes the signature similarities between all protein pairs. We group topologically similar proteins under this measure in a {PPI} network and show that these protein groups belong to the same protein complexes, perform the same biological functions, are localized in the same subcellular compartments, and have the same tissue expressions. Moreover, we apply our technique on a proteome-scale network data and infer biological function of yet unclassified proteins demonstrating that our method can provide valuable guidelines for future experimental research such as disease protein prediction.{AvailabilityData} is available upon request.},

Comparative analyses of biological networks are proving to be valuable, as they can lead to transfer of knowledge between species and give deeper insights into biological function, disease, and evolution. We introduce a new method that uses the Hungarian algorithm to produce optimal global alignment between two networks using any cost function. We design a cost function based solely on network topology and use it in our network alignment. Our method can be applied to any two networks, not just biological ones, since it is based only on network topology. We use our new method to align protein-protein interaction networks of two eukaryotic species and demonstrate that our alignment exposes large and topologically complex regions of network similarity. At the same time, our alignment is biologically valid, since many of the aligned protein pairs perform the same biological function. From the alignment, we predict function of yet unannotated proteins, many of which we validate in the literature. Also, we apply our method to find topological similarities between metabolic networks of different species and build phylogenetic trees based on our network alignment score. The phylogenetic trees obtained in this way bear a striking resemblance to the ones obtained by sequence alignments. Our method detects topologically similar regions in large networks that are statistically significant. It does this independent of protein sequence or any other information external to network topology.},

	abstract = {Malignant transformation usually inhibits terminal cell differentiation but the precise mechanisms involved are not understood. {PU}.1 is a hematopoietic-specific Ets family transcription factor that is required for development of some lymphoid and myeloid lineages. {PU}.1 can also act as an oncoprotein as activation of its expression in erythroid precursors by proviral insertion or transgenesis causes erythroleukemias in mice. Restoration of terminal differentiation in the mouse erythroleukemia ({MEL}) cells requires a decline in the level of {PU}.1, indicating that {PU}.1 can block erythroid differentiation. Here we investigate the mechanism by which {PU}.1 interferes with erythroid differentiation. We find that {PU}.1 interacts directly with {GATA}-1, a zinc finger transcription factor required for erythroid differentiation. Interaction between {PU}.1 and {GATA}-1 requires intact {DNA}-binding domains in both proteins. {PU}.1 represses {GATA}-1-mediated transcriptional activation. Both the {DNA} binding and transactivation domains of {PU}.1 are required for repression and both domains are also needed to block terminal differentiation in {MEL} cells. We also show that ectopic expression of {PU}.1 in Xenopus embryos is sufficient to block erythropoiesis during normal development. Furthermore, introduction of exogenous {GATA}-1 in both {MEL} cells and Xenopus embryos and explants relieves the block to erythroid differentiation imposed by {PU}.1. Our results indicate that the stoichiometry of directly interacting but opposing transcription factors may be a crucial determinant governing processes of normal differentiation and malignant transformation.},

We present single-cell protein and {RNA} co-profiling ({SPARC}), an approach to simultaneously measure global {mRNA} and large sets of intracellular protein in individual cells. Using {SPARC}, we show that {mRNA} expression fails to accurately reflect protein abundance at the time of measurement in human embryonic stem cells, although the direction of changes of {mRNA} and protein expression are in agreement during cellular differentiation. Moreover, protein levels of transcription factors better predict their downstream effects than do the corresponding transcripts. We further show that changes of the balance between protein and {mRNA} expression levels can be applied to infer expression kinetic trajectories, revealing future states of individual cells. Finally, we highlight that {mRNA} expression may be more varied among cells than levels of the corresponding proteins. Overall, our results demonstrate that {mRNA} and protein measurements in single cells provide different and complementary information regarding cell states. Accordingly, {SPARC} can offer valuable insights in gene expression programs of single cells.},

Many methods have been developed that draw on large numbers of expression samples to infer connections between genes (or their products). The result is an aggregate network representing a single estimate for the likelihood of each interaction, or “edge,” in the network. Although informative, aggregate models fail to capture population heterogeneity. Here we propose a method to reverse engineer sample-specific networks from aggregate networks. We demonstrate our approach in several contexts, including simulated, yeast microarray, and human lymphoblastoid cell line {RNA} sequencing data. We use these sample-specific networks to study changes in network topology across time and to characterize shifts in gene regulation that were not apparent in the expression data. We believe that generating sample-specific networks will greatly facilitate the application of network methods to large, complex, and heterogeneous multi-omic datasets, supporting the emerging field of precision network medicine.,

Three distinct cell types are present within the 64-cell stage mouse blastocyst. We have investigated cellular development up to this stage using single-cell expression analysis of more than 500 cells. The 48 genes analyzed were selected in part based on a whole-embryo analysis of more than 800 transcription factors. We show that in the morula, blastomeres coexpress transcription factors specific to different lineages, but by the 64-cell stage three cell types can be clearly distinguished according to their quantitative expression profiles. We identify Id2 and Sox2 as the earliest markers of outer and inner cells, respectively. This is followed by an inverse correlation in expression for the receptor-ligand pair Fgfr2/Fgf4 in the early inner cell mass. Position and signaling events appear to precede the maturation of the transcriptional program. These results illustrate the power of single-cell expression analysis to provide insight into developmental mechanisms. The technique should be widely applicable to other biological systems.},

Similarly to {EMT}, melanoma cells with a melanocytic phenotype can switch to a mesenchymal-like phenotype. However, scattered emerging evidence indicates that additional, intermediate state(s) may exist. In order to search for such new melanoma states and decipher their underlying gene regulatory network ({GRN}), we extensively studied ten patient-derived melanoma cultures by single-cell {RNA}-seq of \&gt;39,000 cells. Although each culture exhibited a unique transcriptome, we identified shared gene regulatory networks that underlie the extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal cell states, as well as one (stable) intermediate state. The intermediate state was corroborated by a distinct open chromatin landscape and governed by the transcription factors {EGR}3, {NFATC}2, and {RXRG}. Single-cell migration assays established that this “transition” state exhibits an intermediate migratory phenotype. Through a dense time-series sampling of single cells and dynamic {GRN} inference, we unraveled the sequential and recurrent arrangement of transcriptional programs at play during phenotype switching that ultimately lead to the mesenchymal cell state. We provide the {scRNA}-Seq data with 39,263 melanoma cells on our {SCope} platform and the {ATAC}-seq data on a {UCSC} hub to jointly serve as a resource for the melanoma field. Together, this exhaustive analysis of melanoma cell state diversity indicates that additional states exists between the two extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal-like states. The {GRN} we identified may serve as a new putative target to prevent the switch to mesenchymal cell state and thereby, acquisition of metastatic and drug resistant potential.},

	abstract = {Mapping the T cell response to hepatitis B
Unlike evaluating antibody responses to infections, studying T cell responses has always been more complicated. A significant hurdle here continues to be the development of reagents to identify and characterize pathogen-specific T cells. Here, Cheng et al. have generated a comprehensive panel of peptide class I major histocompatibility complex tetramers to study {CD}8+ T cells that recognize hepatitis B virus ({HBV}). Using {HBV}-specific tetramers in conjunction with mass cytometry, they have documented functional states of {HBV}-specific {CD}8+ T cells in individuals with chronic {HBV} infection. The tetramer panels generated here to study {HBV}-specific T cells should be of broad utility to the {HBV} research community.
Associations between chronic antigen stimulation, T cell dysfunction, and the expression of various inhibitory receptors are well characterized in several mouse and human systems. During chronic hepatitis B virus ({HBV}) infection ({CHB}), T cell responses are blunted with low frequencies of virus-specific T cells observed, making these parameters difficult to study. Here, using mass cytometry and a highly multiplexed combinatorial peptide–major histocompatibility complex ({pMHC}) tetramer strategy that allows for the detection of rare antigen-specific T cells, we simultaneously probed 484 unique {HLA}-A*1101–restricted epitopes spanning the entire {HBV} genome on T cells from patients at various stages of {CHB}. Numerous {HBV}-specific T cell populations were detected, validated, and profiled. T cells specific for two epitopes ({HBVpol}387 and {HBVcore}169) displayed differing and complex heterogeneities that were associated with the disease progression, and the expression of inhibitory receptors on these cells was not linearly related with their extent of T cell dysfunction. For {HBVcore}169-specific {CD}8+ T cells, we found cellular markers associated with long-term memory, polyfunctionality, and the presence of several previously unidentified public {TCR} clones that correlated with viral control. Using high-dimensional trajectory analysis of these cellular phenotypes, a pseudo-time metric was constructed that fit with the status of viral infection in corresponding patients. This was validated in a longitudinal cohort of patients undergoing antiviral therapy. Our study uncovers complex relationships of inhibitory receptors between the profiles of antigen-specific T cells and the status of {CHB} with implications for new strategies of therapeutic intervention.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β cells. A comprehensive picture of the changes during T1D development is lacking due to limited sample availability, inability to sample longitudinally, and the paucity of technologies enabling comprehensive tissue profiling. Here, we analyzed 1,581 islets from 12 human donors, including eight with T1D, using imaging mass cytometry ({IMC}). {IMC} enabled simultaneous measurement of 35 biomarkers with single-cell and spatial resolution. We performed pseudotime analysis of islets through T1D progression from snapshot data to reconstruct the evolution of β cell loss and insulitis. Our analyses revealed that β cell destruction is preceded by a β cell marker loss and by recruitment of cytotoxic and helper T cells. The approaches described herein demonstrate the value of {IMC} for improving our understanding of T1D pathogenesis, and our data lay the foundation for hypothesis generation and follow-on experiments.},

In multicellular organisms, dedicated regulatory circuits control cell type diversity and responses. The crosstalk and redundancies within these circuits and substantial cellular heterogeneity pose a major research challenge. Here, we present {CRISP}-seq, an integrated method for massively parallel single-cell {RNA} sequencing ({RNA}-seq) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ({CRISPR})-pooled screens. We show that profiling the genomic perturbation and transcriptome in the same cell enables us to simultaneously elucidate the function of multiple factors and their interactions. We applied {CRISP}-seq to probe regulatory circuits of innate immunity. By sampling tens of thousands of perturbed cells in vitro and in mice, we identified interactions and redundancies between developmental and signaling-dependent factors. These include opposing effects of Cebpb and Irf8 in regulating the monocyte/macrophage versus dendritic cell lineages and differential functions for Rela and Stat1/2 in monocyte versus dendritic cell responses to pathogens. This study establishes {CRISP}-seq as a broadly applicable, comprehensive, and unbiased approach for elucidating mammalian regulatory circuits.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in understanding {CD}4+ T-cell differentiation suggest that previous models of a few distinct, stable effector phenotypes were too simplistic. Although several well-characterized phenotypes are still recognized, some states display plasticity, and intermediate phenotypes exist. As a framework for reexamining these concepts, we use Waddington's landscape paradigm, augmented with explicit consideration of stochastic variations. Our animation program ?{LAVA}? visualizes T-cell differentiation as cells moving across a landscape of hills and valleys, leading to attractor basins representing stable or semistable differentiation states. The model illustrates several principles, including: (i) cell populations may behave more predictably than individual cells; (ii) analogous to reticulate evolution, differentiation may proceed through a network of interconnected states, rather than a single well-defined pathway; (iii) relatively minor changes in the barriers between attractor basins can change the stability or plasticity of a population; (iv) intrapopulation variability of gene expression may be an important regulator of differentiation, rather than inconsequential noise; (v) the behavior of some populations may be defined mainly by the behavior of outlier cells. While not a quantitative representation of actual differentiation, our model is intended to provoke discussion of T-cell differentiation pathways, particularly highlighting a probabilistic view of transitions between states.},

Despite multi-modal therapy, survival of high-risk patients remains disappointingly low, underscoring the need for novel treatment strategies. The discovery of {ALK} activating mutations opened the way to precision treatment in a subset of these patients. Previously, we investigated the transcriptional effects of pharmacological {ALK} inhibition on neuroblastoma cell lines, six hours after {TAE}684 administration, resulting in the 77-gene {ALK} signature, which was shown to gradually decrease from 120 minutes after {TAE}684 treatment, to gain deeper insight into the molecular effects of oncogenic {ALK} signaling. Aim: Here, we further dissected the transcriptional dynamic profiles of neuroblastoma cells upon {TAE}684 treatment in a detailed timeframe of ten minutes up to six hours after inhibition, in order to identify additional early targets for combination treatment. Results: We observed an unexpected initial upregulation of positively regulated {MYCN} target genes following subsequent downregulation of overall {MYCN} activity. In addition, we identified adrenomedullin ({ADM}), previously shown to be implicated in sunitinib resistance, as the earliest response gene upon {ALK} inhibition. Conclusions: We describe the early and late effects of {ALK} inhibitor {TAE}684 treatment on the neuroblastoma transcriptome. The observed unexpected upregulation of {ADM} warrants further investigation in relation to putative {ALK} resistance in neuroblastoma patients currently undergoing {ALK} inhibitor treatment.},

Somatic chromosomal copy number aberrations have been shown to be associated with patient outcome, particularly in low- and intermediate-risk neuroblastoma patients. To improve outcome prediction in high-risk neuroblastoma, we aimed to design a prognostic classification method based on copy number aberrations.In an international collaboration, normalized high-resolution {DNA} copy number data ({arrayCGH} and {SNP} arrays) from 556 high-risk neuroblastomas obtained at diagnosis were collected from nine collaborative groups and segmented using the same method. We applied logistic and Cox proportional hazard regression to identify genomic aberrations associated with poor outcome.In this study, we identified two types of copy number aberrations that are associated with extremely poor outcome. Distal 6q losses were detected in 5.9\% of patients and were associated with a 10-year survival probability of only 3.4\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI}] = 0.5\% to 23.3\%, two-sided P = .002). Amplifications of regions not encompassing the {MYCN} locus were detected in 18.1\% of patients and were associated with a 10-year survival probability of only 5.8\% (95\% {CI} = 1.5\% to 22.2\%, two-sided P \&lt; .001).Using a unique large copy number data set of high-risk neuroblastoma cases, we identified a small subset of high-risk neuroblastoma patients with extremely low survival probability that might be eligible for inclusion in clinical trials of new therapeutics.

As part of a topology optimisation process, one could use graphlet counts to iteratively modify a network and keep track of the graphlet counts, in order to achieve certain topological properties. Up until now, however, graphlets were not suited as a metric for performing topology optimisation; when millions of minor changes are made to the network structure it becomes computationally intractable to recalculate all the graphlet counts for each of the edge modifications.   Results {IncGraph} is a method for calculating the differences in graphlet counts with respect to the network in its previous state, which is much more efficient than calculating the graphlet occurrences from scratch at every edge modification made. In comparison to static counting approaches, our findings show {IncGraph} reduces the execution time by several orders of magnitude. The usefulness of this approach was demonstrated by developing a graphlet-based metric to optimise gene regulatory networks. {IncGraph} is able to quickly quantify the topological impact of small changes to a network, which opens novel research opportunities to study changes in topologies in evolving or online networks, or develop graphlet-based criteria for topology optimisation.

Heterogeneity between different macrophage populations has become a defining feature of this lineage. However, the conserved factors defining macrophages remain largely unknown. The transcription factor {ZEB}2 is best described for its role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition; however, its role within the immune system is only now being elucidated. We show here that Zeb2 expression is a conserved feature of macrophages. Using Clec4f-cre, Itgax-cre, and Fcgr1-cre mice to target five different macrophage populations, we found that loss of {ZEB}2 resulted in macrophage disappearance from the tissues, coupled with their subsequent replenishment from bone-marrow precursors in open niches. Mechanistically, we found that {ZEB}2 functioned to maintain the tissue-specific identities of macrophages. In Kupffer cells, {ZEB}2 achieved this by regulating expression of the transcription factor {LXRα}, removal of which recapitulated the loss of Kupffer cell identity and disappearance. Thus, {ZEB}2 expression is required in macrophages to preserve their tissue-specific identities.},

	abstract = {Abstract At the heart of the development of fertilized eggs into fully formed organisms and the adaptation of cells to changed conditions are genetic regulatory networks ({GRNs}). In higher multicellular organisms, signal selection and multiplexing are performed at the cis-regulatory domains of genes, where combinations of transcription factors ({TFs}) regulate the rates at which the genes are transcribed into {mRNA}. To be able to act as activators or repressors of gene transcription, {TFs} must first bind to target sequences on the regulatory domains. Two {TFs} that act in concert may bind entirely independently of each other, but more often binding of the first one will alter the affinity of the other for its binding site. This article presents a systematic investigation into the effect of {TF} binding dependences on the predicted regulatory function of this bio-logic. Four extreme scenarios, commonly used to classify enzyme activation and inhibition patterns, for the binding of two {TFs} were explored: independent (the {TFs} bind without affecting each other's affinities), competitive (the {TFs} compete for the same binding site), ordered (the {TFs} bind in a compulsory order), and joint binding (the {TFs} either bind as a preformed complex, or binding of one is virtually impossible in the absence of the other). The conclusions are: (1) the laws of combinatorial logic hold only for systems with independently binding {TFs}; (2) systems formed according to the other scenarios can mimic the functions of their Boolean logical counterparts, but cannot be combined or decomposed in the same way; and (3) the continuously scaled output of systems consisting of competitively binding activators and repressors can be controlled more robustly than that of single {TF} or (quasi-)logical multi-{TF} systems.},

In order to understand how the context-dependent crosstalk of different cell types enables physiological processes to proceed, we developed {CellPhoneDB}, a novel repository of ligands, receptors and their interactions$^{\textrm{1}}$. Our repository takes into account the subunit architecture of both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. We integrated our resource with a statistical framework that predicts enriched cellular interactions between two cell types from single-cell transcriptomics data. Here, we outline the structure and content of our repository, the procedures for inferring cell-cell communication networks from {scRNA}-seq data and present a practical step-by-step guide to help implement the protocol. {CellPhoneDB} v2.0 is a novel version of our resource that incorporates additional functionalities to allow users to introduce new interacting molecules and reduce the time and resources needed to interrogate large datasets. {CellPhoneDB} v2.0 is publicly available at https://github.com/Teichlab/cellphonedb and as a user-friendly web interface at http://www.cellphonedb.org/. In our protocol, we demonstrate how to reveal meaningful biological discoveries from {CellPhoneDB} v2.0 using published data sets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A complex disease like cancer is hardly caused by one gene or one protein singly. It is usually caused by the perturbation of the network formed by several genes or proteins. In the last decade several research teams have attempted to construct interaction maps of genes and proteins
either experimentally or reverse engineer interaction maps using computational techniques. These networks were usually created under a certain condition such as an environmental condition, a particular disease, or a specific tissue type. Lately, however, there has been greater emphasis on
finding the differential structure of the existing network topology under a novel condition or disease status to elucidate the perturbation in a biological system. In this review/tutorial article we briefly mention some of the research done in this area; we mainly illustrate the computational/statistical
methods developed by our team in recent years for differential network analysis using publicly available gene expression data collected from a well known cancer study. This data includes a group of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and a group with acute myeloid leukemia. In particular,
we describe the statistical tests to detect the change in the network topology based on connectivity scores which measure the association or interaction between pairs of genes. The tests under various scores are applied to this data set to perform a differential network analysis on gene expression
for human leukemia. We believe that, in the future, differential network analysis will be a standard way to view the changes in gene expression and protein expression data globally and these types of tests could be useful in analyzing the complex differential signatures.},

Mapping gene expression at the single-cell level within tissues remains a technical challenge. Rodriques et al. developed a method called Slide-seq, whereby {RNA} was spatially resolved from tissue sections by transfer onto a surface covered with {DNA}-barcoded beads. Applying Slide-seq to regions of a mouse brain revealed spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of the cerebellum and axes of variation across Purkinje cell compartments. The authors used this method to dissect the temporal evolution of cell type–specific responses in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury.
Science, this issue p. 1463
Spatial positions of cells in tissues strongly influence function, yet a high-throughput, genome-wide readout of gene expression with cellular resolution is lacking. We developed Slide-seq, a method for transferring {RNA} from tissue sections onto a surface covered in {DNA}-barcoded beads with known positions, allowing the locations of the {RNA} to be inferred by sequencing. Using Slide-seq, we localized cell types identified by single-cell {RNA} sequencing datasets within the cerebellum and hippocampus, characterized spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of mouse cerebellum, and defined the temporal evolution of cell type–specific responses in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. These studies highlight how Slide-seq provides a scalable method for obtaining spatially resolved gene expression data at resolutions comparable to the sizes of individual cells.
An {RNA} sequencing technique is developed that can measure genome-wide gene expression in complex tissues at 10-micrometer resolution.

{RNA}-seq and similar methods can record gene expression within and among cells. Current methods typically lose positional information and many require arduous single-cell isolation and sequencing. Ståhl et al. have developed a way of measuring the spatial distribution of transcripts by annealing fixed brain or cancer tissue samples directly to bar-coded reverse transcriptase primers, performing reverse transcription followed by sequencing and computational reconstruction, and they can do so for multiple genes.
Science, this issue p. 78
Analysis of the pattern of proteins or {messengerRNAs} ({mRNAs}) in histological tissue sections is a cornerstone in biomedical research and diagnostics. This typically involves the visualization of a few proteins or expressed genes at a time. We have devised a strategy, which we call “spatial transcriptomics,” that allows visualization and quantitative analysis of the transcriptome with spatial resolution in individual tissue sections. By positioning histological sections on arrayed reverse transcription primers with unique positional barcodes, we demonstrate high-quality {RNA}-sequencing data with maintained two-dimensional positional information from the mouse brain and human breast cancer. Spatial transcriptomics provides quantitative gene expression data and visualization of the distribution of {mRNAs} within tissue sections and enables novel types of bioinformatics analyses, valuable in research and diagnostics.
A new technique allows visualization and quantitative analysis of the spatially resolved transcriptome across individual tissue sections.

However, most reprogramming systems are inefficient, converting only a fraction of cells to the desired state. Here, we analyze {MYOD}-mediated reprogramming of human fibroblasts to myotubes, a well-characterized model system for direct conversion by defined factors, at pseudotemporal resolution using single-cell {RNA}-seq. To expose barriers to efficient conversion, we introduce a novel analytic technique, trajectory alignment, which enables quantitative comparison of gene expression kinetics across two biological processes. Reprogrammed cells navigate a trajectory with branch points that correspond to two alternative decision points, with cells that select incorrect branches terminating at aberrant or incomplete reprogramming outcomes. Analysis of these branch points revealed insulin and {BMP} signaling as crucial molecular determinants of reprogramming. Single-cell trajectory alignment enables rigorous quantitative comparisons between biological trajectories found in diverse processes in development, reprogramming, and other contexts.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The introduction of {RNA} velocity in single cells has opened up new ways of studying cellular differentiation. The originally proposed framework obtains velocities as the deviation of the observed ratio of spliced and unspliced {mRNA} from an inferred steady state. Errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state {mRNA} levels are violated. With {scVelo} (https://scvelo.org), we address these restrictions by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes {RNA} velocity to a wide variety of systems comprising transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, and recover the latent time of the underlying cellular processes. This latent time represents the cell’s internal clock and is based only on its transcriptional dynamics. Moreover, {scVelo} allows us to identify regimes of regulatory changes such as stages of cell fate commitment and, therein, systematically detects putative driver genes. We demonstrate that {scVelo} enables disentangling heterogeneous subpopulation kinetics with unprecedented resolution in hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We anticipate that {scVelo} will greatly facilitate the study of lineage decisions, gene regulation, and pathway activity identification.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Transcriptional responses to extracellular stimuli involve tuning the rates of transcript production and degradation. Here, we show that the time-dependent profiles of these rates can be inferred from simultaneous measurements of precursor {mRNA} (pre-{mRNA}) and mature {mRNA} profiles. Transcriptome-wide measurements demonstrate that genes with similar {mRNA} profiles often exhibit marked differences in the amplitude and onset of their production rate. The latter is characterized by a large dynamic range, with a group of genes exhibiting an unexpectedly strong transient production overshoot, thereby accelerating their induction and, when combined with time-dependent degradation, shaping transient responses with precise timing and amplitude.},

This resulting aggregate network, in essence, averages over the networks of those individuals in the population. {LIONESS} (Linear Interpolation to Obtain Network Estimates for Single Samples) is a method that can be used together with a network inference algorithm to extract networks for individual samples in a population. The method’s key characteristic is that, by modeling networks for individual samples in a data set, it can capture network heterogeneity in a population. {LIONESS} was originally made available as a function within the {PANDA} (Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation) regulatory network reconstruction framework. However, the {LIONESS} algorithm is generalizable and can be used to model single sample networks based on a wide range of network inference algorithms.},

	abstract = {Gene expression is a multistep process that involves the transcription, translation and turnover of messenger {RNAs} and proteins. Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale. Here we simultaneously measured absolute {mRNA} and protein abundance and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than 5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas {mRNA} and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of {mRNAs} and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of {mRNA} and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a greater understanding of the underlying design principles.},

	abstract = {Regulatory network reconstruction is a fundamental problem in computational biology. There are significant limitations to such reconstruction using individual datasets, and increasingly people attempt to construct networks using multiple, independent datasets obtained from complementary sources, but methods for this integration are lacking. We developed {PANDA} (Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation), a message-passing model using multiple sources of information to predict regulatory relationships, and used it to integrate protein-protein interaction, gene expression, and sequence motif data to reconstruct genome-wide, condition-specific regulatory networks in yeast as a model. The resulting networks were not only more accurate than those produced using individual data sets and other existing methods, but they also captured information regarding specific biological mechanisms and pathways that were missed using other methodologies. {PANDA} is scalable to higher eukaryotes, applicable to specific tissue or cell type data and conceptually generalizable to include a variety of regulatory, interaction, expression, and other genome-scale data. An implementation of the {PANDA} algorithm is available at www.sourceforge.net/projects/panda-net.},
