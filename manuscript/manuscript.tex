  abstract = {RNA velocity has opened up new ways of studying cellular differentiation in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. It describes the rate of gene expression change for an individual gene at a given time point based on the ratio of its spliced and unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA). However, errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. Here we present scVelo, a method that overcomes these limitations by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to systems with transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We apply scVelo to disentangling subpopulation kinetics in neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, recover each cell's position in the underlying differentiation processes and detect putative driver genes. scVelo will facilitate the study of lineage decisions and gene regulation.},

However, most reprogramming systems are inefficient, converting only a fraction of cells to the desired state. Here, we analyze MYOD-mediated reprogramming of human fibroblasts to myotubes, a well-characterized model system for direct conversion by defined factors, at pseudotemporal resolution using single-cell RNA-seq. To expose barriers to efficient conversion, we introduce a novel analytic technique, trajectory alignment, which enables quantitative comparison of gene expression kinetics across two biological processes. Reprogrammed cells navigate a trajectory with branch points that correspond to two alternative decision points, with cells that select incorrect branches terminating at aberrant or incomplete reprogramming outcomes. Analysis of these branch points revealed insulin and BMP signaling as crucial molecular determinants of reprogramming. Single-cell trajectory alignment enables rigorous quantitative comparisons between biological trajectories found in diverse processes in development, reprogramming, and other contexts.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Subpopulation identification, usually via some form of unsupervised clustering, is a fundamental step in the analysis of many single-cell RNA-seq data sets. This has motivated the development and application of a broad range of clustering methods, based on various underlying algorithms. Here, we provide a systematic and extensible performance evaluation of 14 clustering algorithms implemented in R, including both methods developed explicitly for scRNA-seq data and more general-purpose methods. The methods were evaluated using nine publicly available scRNA-seq data sets as well as three simulations with varying degree of cluster separability. The same feature selection approaches were used for all methods, allowing us to focus on the investigation of the performance of the clustering algorithms themselves. We evaluated the ability of recovering known subpopulations, the stability and the run time and scalability of the methods. Additionally, we investigated whether the performance could be improved by generating consensus partitions from multiple individual clustering methods. We found substantial differences in the performance, run time and stability between the methods, with SC3 and Seurat showing the most favorable results. Additionally, we found that consensus clustering typically did not improve the performance compared to the best of the combined methods, but that several of the top-performing methods already perform some type of consensus clustering. All the code used for the evaluation is available on GitHub ( https://github.com/markrobinsonuzh/scRNAseq\_clustering\_comparison). In addition, an R package providing access to data and clustering results, thereby facilitating inclusion of new methods and data sets, is available from Bioconductor ( https://bioconductor.org/packages/DuoClustering2018).},

Here we report the BAMSurgeon tool for simulating cancer genomes and the results of 248 analyses of three in silico tumors created with it. Different algorithms exhibit characteristic error profiles, and, intriguingly, false positives show a trinucleotide profile very similar to one found in human tumors. Although the three simulated tumors differ in sequence contamination (deviation from normal cell sequence) and in subclonality, an ensemble of pipelines outperforms the best individual pipeline in all cases.

Cells, represented by balls, roll downhill through a landscape of bifurcating valleys.

Here I examine models of two important developmental processes \$\textbackslash backslash\$textemdash\{\} cell-fate induction and lateral inhibition \$\textbackslash backslash\$textemdash\{\} and ask whether the landscapes for these models at least qualitatively resemble Waddington's picture. For cell-fate induction, the answer is no. The commitment of a cell to a new fate corresponds to the disappearance of a valley from the landscape, not the splitting of one valley into two, and it occurs through a type of bifurcation \$\textbackslash backslash\$textemdash\{\} a saddle-node bifurcation \$\textbackslash backslash\$textemdash\{\} that possesses an intrinsic irreversibility that is missing from Waddington's picture. Lateral inhibition, a symmetrical cell\$\textbackslash backslash\$textendash\{\}cell competition process, corresponds better to Waddington's picture, with one valley reversibly splitting into two through a pitchfork bifurcation. I propose an alternative epigenetic landscape that has numerous valleys and ridges right from the start, with the process of cell-fate commitment corresponding to the irreversible disappearance of some of these valleys and ridges, via cell-fate induction, complemented by the creation of new valleys and ridges through processes like cell\$\textbackslash backslash\$textendash\{\}cell competition.},

The resulting networks were not only more accurate than those produced using individual data sets and other existing methods, but they also captured information regarding specific biological mechanisms and pathways that were missed using other methodologies. PANDA is scalable to higher eukaryotes, applicable to specific tissue or cell type data and conceptually generalizable to include a variety of regulatory, interaction, expression, and other genome-scale data.

A battery of reverse engineering methods has been developed in recent years to reconstruct the underlying GRNs from these and other experimental data. However, the performance of the individual methods is poorly understood and validation of algorithmic performances is still missing to a large extent. To enable such systematic validation, we have developed the web application GeNGe (GEne Network GEnerator), a controlled framework for the automatic generation of GRNs. The theoretical model for a GRN is a non-linear differential equation system. Networks can be user-defined or constructed in a modular way with the option to introduce global and local network perturbations. Resulting data can be used, e.g. as benchmark data for evaluating GRN reconstruction methods or for predicting effects of perturbations as theoretical counterparts of biological experiments.Availability: Available online at http://genge.molgen.mpg.deContact:hache@molgen.mpg.deSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {One of the pressing open problems of computational systems biology is the elucidation of the topology of genetic regulatory networks (GRNs) using high throughput genomic data, in particular microarray gene expression data. The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) challenge aims to evaluate the success of GRN inference algorithms on benchmarks of simulated data. In this article, we present GENIE3, a new algorithm for the inference of GRNs that was best performer in the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge. GENIE3 decomposes the prediction of a regulatory network between p genes into p different regression problems. In each of the regression problems, the expression pattern of one of the genes (target gene) is predicted from the expression patterns of all the other genes (input genes), using tree-based ensemble methods Random Forests or Extra-Trees. The importance of an input gene in the prediction of the target gene expression pattern is taken as an indication of a putative regulatory link. Putative regulatory links are then aggregated over all genes to provide a ranking of interactions from which the whole network is reconstructed. In addition to performing well on the DREAM4 In Silico Multifactorial challenge simulated data, we show that GENIE3 compares favorably with existing algorithms to decipher the genetic regulatory network of Escherichia coli. It doesn't make any assumption about the nature of gene regulation, can deal with combinatorial and non-linear interactions, produces directed GRNs, and is fast and scalable. In conclusion, we propose a new algorithm for GRN inference that performs well on both synthetic and real gene expression data. The algorithm, based on feature selection with tree-based ensemble methods, is simple and generic, making it adaptable to other types of genomic data and interactions.},

Many methods have been developed to reconstruct network models that attempt to capture those interactions. These methods often draw on large numbers of measured expression samples to tease out subtle signals and infer connections between genes (or gene products). The result is an aggregate network model representing a single estimate for edge likelihoods. While informative, aggregate models fail to capture the heterogeneity that is often represented in a population. Here we propose a method to reverse engineer sample-specific networks from aggregate network models. We demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of our approach in several datasets, including simulated data, microarray expression data from synchronized yeast cells, and RNA-seq data collected from human subjects. We show that these sample-specific networks can be used to study the evolution of network topology across time and to characterize shifts in gene regulation that may not be apparent in the expression data. We believe the ability to generate sample-specific networks will revolutionize the field of network biology and has the potential to usher in an era of precision network medicine.},

Many methods have been developed that draw on large numbers of expression samples to infer connections between genes (or their products). The result is an aggregate network representing a single estimate for the likelihood of each interaction, or ``edge,'' in the network.

To capitalise on the large collection of well-annotated scRNA-seq datasets, we developed scClassify, a multiscale classification framework based on ensemble learning and cell type hierarchies constructed from single or multiple annotated datasets as references. scClassify enables the estimation of sample size required for accurate classification of cell types in a cell type hierarchy and allows joint classification of cells when multiple references are available. We show that scClassify consistently performs better than other supervised cell type classification methods across 114 pairs of reference and testing data, representing a diverse combination of sizes, technologies and levels of complexity, and further demonstrate the unique components of scClassify through simulations and compendia of experimental datasets. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of scClassify on large single-cell atlases and highlight a novel application of identifying subpopulations of cells from the Tabula Muris data that were unidentified in the original publication. Together, scClassify represents state-of-the-art methodology in automated cell type identification from scRNA-seq data.},

  abstract = {A complex disease generally results not from malfunction of individual molecules but from dysfunction of the relevant system or network, which dynamically changes with time and conditions. Thus, estimating a condition-specific network from a single sample is crucial to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of complex diseases at the system level. However, there is currently no effective way to construct such an individual-specific network by expression profiling of a single sample because of the requirement of multiple samples for computing correlations. We developed here with a statistical method, i.e. a sample-specific network (SSN) method, which allows us to construct individual-specific networks based on molecular expressions of a single sample. Using this method, we can characterize various human diseases at a network level. In particular, such SSNs can lead to the identification of individual-specific disease modules as well as driver genes, even without gene sequencing information. Extensive analysis by using the Cancer Genome Atlas data not only demonstrated the effectiveness of the method, but also found new individual-specific driver genes and network patterns for various types of cancer. Biological experiments on drug resistance further validated one important advantage of our method over the traditional methods, i.e. we can even identify such drug resistance genes that actually have no clear differential expression between samples with and without the resistance, due to the additional network information.},

Here, we detail the steps of a typical single-cell RNA-seq analysis, including pre-processing (quality control, normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell- and gene-level downstream analysis. We formulate current best-practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies. We have integrated these best-practice recommendations into a workflow, which we apply to a public dataset to further illustrate how these steps work in practice.

In particular, all but the best-performing method failed to accurately infer multiple regulatory inputs (combinatorial regulation) of genes.

The onslaught of data is accelerating as molecular profiling technology evolves. The Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) is a community effort to catalyze discussion about the design, application, and assessment of systems biology models through annual reverse-engineering challenges. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We describe our assessments of the four challenges associated with the third DREAM conference which came to be known as the DREAM3 challenges: signaling cascade identification, signaling response prediction, gene expression prediction, and the DREAM3 in silico network challenge. The challenges, based on anonymized data sets, tested participants in network inference and prediction of measurements. Forty teams submitted 413 predicted networks and measurement test sets. Overall, a handful of best-performer teams were identified, while a majority of teams made predictions that were equivalent to random. Counterintuitively, combining the predictions of multiple teams (including the weaker teams) can in some cases improve predictive power beyond that of any single method. CONCLUSIONS: DREAM provides valuable feedback to practitioners of systems biology modeling.

  abstract = {Malignant transformation usually inhibits terminal cell differentiation but the precise mechanisms involved are not understood. PU.1 is a hematopoietic-specific Ets family transcription factor that is required for development of some lymphoid and myeloid lineages. PU.1 can also act as an oncoprotein as activation of its expression in erythroid precursors by proviral insertion or transgenesis causes erythroleukemias in mice. Restoration of terminal differentiation in the mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells requires a decline in the level of PU.1, indicating that PU.1 can block erythroid differentiation. Here we investigate the mechanism by which PU.1 interferes with erythroid differentiation. We find that PU.1 interacts directly with GATA-1, a zinc finger transcription factor required for erythroid differentiation. Interaction between PU.1 and GATA-1 requires intact DNA-binding domains in both proteins. PU.1 represses GATA-1-mediated transcriptional activation. Both the DNA binding and transactivation domains of PU.1 are required for repression and both domains are also needed to block terminal differentiation in MEL cells. We also show that ectopic expression of PU.1 in Xenopus embryos is sufficient to block erythropoiesis during normal development. Furthermore, introduction of exogenous GATA-1 in both MEL cells and Xenopus embryos and explants relieves the block to erythroid differentiation imposed by PU.1. Our results indicate that the stoichiometry of directly interacting but opposing transcription factors may be a crucial determinant governing processes of normal differentiation and malignant transformation.},

Explicit modeling of the protein interactions allows RENCO to incorporate greater mechanistic detail of the transcription machinery compared to existing models and can provide a better assessment of algorithms for regulatory network inference.Availability: RENCO is a C++ command line program, available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/renco/Contact:terran@cs.unm.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

However, accurate and systematic evaluation of these methods is hampered by the difficulty of constructing adequate benchmarks and the lack of tools for a differentiated analysis of network predictions on such benchmarks. RESULTS: Here, we describe a novel and comprehensive method for in silico benchmark generation and performance profiling of network inference methods available to the community as an open-source software called GeneNetWeaver (GNW). In addition to the generation of detailed dynamical models of gene regulatory networks to be used as benchmarks, GNW provides a network motif analysis that reveals systematic prediction errors, thereby indicating potential ways of improving inference methods. The accuracy of network inference methods is evaluated using standard metrics such as precision-recall and receiver operating characteristic curves. We show how GNW can be used to assess the performance and identify the strengths and weaknesses of six inference methods. Furthermore, we used GNW to provide the international Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) competition with three network inference challenges (DREAM3, DREAM4 and DREAM5).

  abstract = {Abstract At the heart of the development of fertilized eggs into fully formed organisms and the adaptation of cells to changed conditions are genetic regulatory networks (GRNs). In higher multicellular organisms, signal selection and multiplexing are performed at the cis-regulatory domains of genes, where combinations of transcription factors (TFs) regulate the rates at which the genes are transcribed into mRNA. To be able to act as activators or repressors of gene transcription, TFs must first bind to target sequences on the regulatory domains. Two TFs that act in concert may bind entirely independently of each other, but more often binding of the first one will alter the affinity of the other for its binding site. This article presents a systematic investigation into the effect of TF binding dependences on the predicted regulatory function of this bio-logic. Four extreme scenarios, commonly used to classify enzyme activation and inhibition patterns, for the binding of two TFs were explored: independent (the TFs bind without affecting each other's affinities), competitive (the TFs compete for the same binding site), ordered (the TFs bind in a compulsory order), and joint binding (the TFs either bind as a preformed complex, or binding of one is virtually impossible in the absence of the other). The conclusions are: (1) the laws of combinatorial logic hold only for systems with independently binding TFs; (2) systems formed according to the other scenarios can mimic the functions of their Boolean logical counterparts, but cannot be combined or decomposed in the same way; and (3) the continuously scaled output of systems consisting of competitively binding activators and repressors can be controlled more robustly than that of single TF or (quasi-)logical multi-TF systems.},

Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale. Here we simultaneously measured absolute mRNA and protein abundance and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than 5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas mRNA and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of mRNAs and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of mRNA and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a greater understanding of the underlying design principles.},

SCENIC reconstructs regulons (i.e., transcription factors and their target genes) assesses the activity of these discovered regulons in individual cells and uses these cellular activity patterns to find meaningful clusters of cells. Here we present an improved version of SCENIC with several advances. SCENIC has been refactored and reimplemented in Python (pySCENIC), resulting in a tenfold increase in speed, and has been packaged into containers for ease of use. It is now also possible to use epigenomic track databases, as well as motifs, to refine regulons. In this protocol, we explain the different steps of SCENIC: the workflow starts from the count matrix depicting the gene abundances for all cells and consists of three stages. First, coexpression modules are inferred using a regression per-target approach (GRNBoost2). Next, the indirect targets are pruned from these modules using cis-regulatory motif discovery (cisTarget). Lastly, the activity of these regulons is quantified via an enrichment score for the regulon's target genes (AUCell). Nonlinear projection methods can be used to display visual groupings of cells based on the cellular activity patterns of these regulons. The results can be exported as a loom file and visualized in the SCope web application. This protocol is illustrated on two use cases: a peripheral blood mononuclear cell data set and a panel of single-cell RNA-sequencing cancer experiments. For a data set of 10,000 genes and 50,000 cells, the pipeline runs in {$<$}2 h.},

The cells can have states with the higher probability ones giving the different cell types. Different cell types correspond to different basins of attractions of the probability landscape. We study how the cells develop from undifferentiated cells to differentiated cells from landscape perspectives. We quantified the Waddington landscape through construction of underlying probability landscape for cell development. We show the developmental process proceeds as moving from undifferentiated to the differentiated basins of attractions. The barrier height of the basins of attractions correlates with the escape time that determines the stability of cell types. We show that the developmental process can be quantitatively described and uncovered by the biological paths on the quantified Waddington landscape from undifferentiated to the differentiated cells. We found the dynamics of the developmental process is controlled by a combination of the gradient and curl force on the landscape. The biological paths often do not follow the steepest descent path on the landscape. The landscape framework also quantifies the possibility of reverse differentiation process such as cell reprogramming from differentiated cells back to the original stem cell. We show that the biological path of reverse differentiation is irreversible and different from the one for differentiation process. We found that the developmental process described by the underlying landscape and the associated biological paths is relatively stable and robust against the influences of environmental perturbations.},

IRF8 dampened signaling via the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), facilitated antigen-specific interaction with helper T cells, and promoted antibody affinity maturation while antagonizing IRF4-driven differentiation of plasmablasts. Genomic analysis revealed concentration-dependent actions of IRF4 and IRF8 in regulating distinct gene-expression programs.

\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

We present dyngen, a novel, multi-modal simulation engine for studying
dynamic cellular processes at single-cell resolution. dyngen is more
flexible than current single-cell simulation engines, and allows better
method development and benchmarking, thereby stimulating development and
testing of novel computational methods. We demonstrate its potential for
spearheading novel computational methods on three novel applications:
aligning cell developmental trajectories, cell-specific regulatory
network inference and estimation of RNA velocity.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Single-cell simulation engines are becoming increasingly important for
testing and benchmarking computational methods, a pressing need in the
widely expanding field of single-cell biology. Complementary to real
biological data, synthetic data provides a valuable alternative where
the actual ground truth is completely known and thus can be compared to,
in order to make quantitative evaluations of computational methods that
aim to reconstruct this ground truth
\autocite{zappia_splattersimulationsinglecell_2017}. In addition,
simulation engines are more flexible when it comes to stress-testing
computational methods, for example by varying the parameters of the
simulation, such as the amount of noise, samples, and cells measured,
allowing benchmarking of methods over a wide range of possible
scenarios. In this way, they can even guide the design of real
biological experiments, finding out the best conditions to be used as
input for subsequent computational pipelines.

Another, more experimental use of simulation engines is their important
role in spearheading the development of novel computational methods,
possibly even before real data is available. In this way, simulation
engines can be used to assess the value of novel experimental protocols
or treatments. Simulation engines are also increasingly important when
it comes to finding alternatives to animal models, for example for drug
testing and precision medicine. In such scenarios, cellular simulations
can act as digital twins, offering unlimited experimentation \emph{in
silico} \autocite{bjornsson_digitaltwinspersonalize_2019}.

Simulating realistic data requires that the underlying biology is
recapitulated as best as possible, and in the case of transcriptomics
data this typically involves modelling the underlying gene regulatory
networks. Simulators of ``bulk'' microarray or RNA-sequencing profiles
simulate biological processes (e.g.~transcription, translation) by
translating a database of known regulatory interactions into a set of
ordinary differential equations (ODE)
\autocite{roy_systemgeneratingtranscription_2008,hache_gengesystematicgeneration_2009,schaffter_genenetweaversilicobenchmark_2011,vandenbulcke_syntrengeneratorsynthetic_2006}.
These methods have been instrumental in performing benchmarking studies
\autocite{prill_rigorousassessmentsystems_2010,marbach_revealingstrengthsweaknesses_2010,marbach_wisdomcrowdsrobust_2012}.
However, the advent of single-cell omics introduced several new types of
analyses (e.g.~trajectory inference, RNA velocity, cell-specific network
inference) which exploit the higher resolution of single-cell versus
bulk omics \autocite{luecken_currentbestpractices_2019}. In addition,
the data characteristics of single-cell omics are vastly different from
bulk omics, typically having much lower library sizes and a higher
dropout rate, but also a high number of profiles
\autocite{vallejos_normalizingsinglecellrna_2017}. The low library
sizes, in particular, are problematic as ODEs are ill-suited for
performing low-molecule simulations
\autocite{gillespie_exactstochasticsimulation_1977}. This necessitates
the development of new single-cell simulators.

To this end, single-cell omics simulators emulate the technical
procedures from single-cell omics protocols. Simulators such as Splatter
\autocite{zappia_splattersimulationsinglecell_2017}, powsimR
\autocite{vieth_powsimrpoweranalysis_2017}, PROSSTT
\autocite{papadopoulos_prossttprobabilisticsimulation_2019} and SymSim
\autocite{zhang_simulatingmultiplefaceted_2019}) have already been
widely used to compare single-cell methods
\autocite{street_slingshotcelllineage_2018,parra_reconstructingcomplexlineage_2019,lummertzdarocha_reconstructioncomplexsinglecell_2018,lin_scclassifysamplesize_2020}
and perform independent benchmarks
\autocite{duo_systematicperformanceevaluation_2018,saelens_comparisonsinglecelltrajectory_2019,soneson_biasrobustnessscalability_2018}.
However, by focusing more on simulating the single-cell omics protocol
(e.g.~RNA capture, amplification, sequencing) and less on the underlying
biology (e.g.~transcription, splicing, translation), their applicability
and reusability is limited towards the specific application for which
they were designed (e.g.~benchmarking clustering or differential
expression methods), and extending these tools to include additional
modalities or experimental conditions is challenging.

We introduce dyngen, a method for simulating cellular dynamics at a
single-cell, single-transcript resolution (Figure~\ref{fig:overview}).
This problem is tackled in three fully-configurable main steps. First,
biological processes are mimicked by translating a gene regulatory
network into a set of reactions (regulation, transcription, splicing,
translation). Second, individual cells are simulated using Gillespie's
stochastic simulation algorithm
\autocite{gillespie_exactstochasticsimulation_1977}, which is designed
to work well in low-molecule simulations. Finally, real reference
datasets are used to emulate single-cell omics profiling protocols.

Throughout a simulation, dyngen tracks many layers of information,
including the abundance of any molecule in the cell, the progression of
the cell along a dynamic process, and the activation strength of
individual regulatory interactions. In addition, dyngen can simulate a
large variety of dynamic processes (e.g.~cyclic, branching,
disconnected) as well as a broad range of experimental conditions
(e.g.~batch effects and time-series, perturbation and single-cell
knockdown experiments). For these reasons, dyngen can cater to a wide
range of benchmarking applications, including trajectory inference,
trajectory alignment, and trajectory differential expression
(Supplementary Table~1).

\section{Results}\label{results}}

We demonstrate dyngen's broad applicability by evaluating three novel
types of computational approaches for which no simulation engines exist
yet: cell-specific network inference, trajectory alignment and RNA
velocity (Figure~\ref{fig:applications}). We emphasize that our main aim
here is to illustrate the potential of dyngen for these evaluations,
rather than performing large-scale benchmarking, which would require
assessing many more quantitative and qualitative aspects of each method
\autocite{weber_essentialguidelinescomputational_2019}.

      \textbf{A:} Trajectory alignment aligns two trajectories between samples. We evaluate dynamic time warping (DTW) and cellAlign when aligning two linear trajectories with different kinetic parameters based on the area differences between the worst possible alignment and the predicted alignment (Area Between Worst And Prediction, or ABWAP). 
      \textbf{B:} RNA velocity calculates for each cell the direction in which the expression of each gene is moving. We evaluated scVelo and velocyto by comparing these vectors with the known velocity vector (velocity correlation) and with the known direction of the cellular trajectory in a dimensionality reduction (velocity arrow cosine).
      \textbf{C:} Cell-specific network inference (CSNI) predicts the regulatory network of every individual cell. We evaluate each cell-specific regulatory network with typical metrics for network inference: the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics-curve (AUROC) and Area Under the Precision Recall-curve (AUPR). We evaluate three CSNI methods by computing the mean AUROC and AUPR across all cells.

    \label{fig:applications}
\end{figure}

Use-case ``trajectory alignment''. Trajectory alignment methods align
trajectories from different samples and allow studying the differences
between the different trajectories. For example, by comparing the
transcriptomic profiles of cells from a diseased patient to a healthy
control, it might be possible to detect transcriptomics differences
(differential expression) of particular cells along a developmental
process, or to detect an early stop of the trajectory of the diseased
patient. Currently, trajectory alignment is limited to aligning linear
trajectories, though other topologies of a trajectory could be aligned
as well. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
\autocite{giorgino_computingvisualizingdynamic_2009} is a method
designed for aligning temporal sequences for speech recognition but has
since been used to compare gene expression kinetics from many different
biological processes
\autocite{cacchiarelli_aligningsinglecelldevelopmental_2018,kanton_organoidsinglecellgenomic_2019,mcfaline-figueroa_pooledsinglecellgenetic_2019,alpert_alignmentsinglecelltrajectories_2018}.
cellAlign \autocite{alpert_alignmentsinglecelltrajectories_2018} uses
DTW to perform trajectory alignment, but also includes interpolation and
scaling of the single cell data as a preprocessing step. We evaluate the
performance of DTW and cellAlign by simulating 40 datasets, each
containing two linear trajectories generated with the same gene
regulatory network but with slightly different simulation kinetics. We
assess the accuracy of the obtained alignments by comparing the
generated alignment path with the worst possible alignment that could be
performed (Supplementary Fig. ~1D), named the Area Between Worst And
Prediction (ABWAP) score. Overall, cellAlign performs significantly
better than DTW (Supplementary Fig.~1), which is likely due to the
interpolation and scaling steps provided by cellAlign, reducing noise in
the data and improving the comparability of the trajectories. Note that,
in this comparison, only linear trajectory alignment is performed. While
dyngen can generate non-linear trajectories (e.g.~cyclic or branching),
both aligning non-linear trajectories and constructing a quantitative
accuracy metric for non-linear trajectory alignment is not trivial and
an avenue for future work.

Use-case ``RNA velocity''. RNA velocity methods use the relative ratio
between pre-mRNA and mature mRNA reads to predict the rate of
increase/decrease of RNA molecule abundance, as this can be used to
predict the directionality of single cell differentiation in
trajectories
\autocite{zeisel_coupledpremrnamrna_2011,lamanno_rnavelocitysingle_2018}.
Already two algorithms are currently available for estimating the RNA
velocity vector from spliced and unspliced counts: velocyto
\autocite{lamanno_rnavelocitysingle_2018} and scvelo
\autocite{bergen_generalizingrnavelocity_2020}. Yet, to date, no
quantitative assessment of their accuracy has been performed, mainly due
to the difficulty in obtaining real ground-truth data to do so. In
contrast, the ground-truth RNA velocity can be easily extracted from a
dyngen simulation, as it is possible to store the rate at which mRNA
molecules are being transcribed and degraded at any particular point in
time. We executed velocyto and scvelo (with 2 different parameter
settings, stochastic and dynamical) on 42 datasets with a variety of
backbones (including linear, bifurcating, cyclic, disconnected). We
evaluated the predictions using two metrics (Supplementary Fig.~2), one
which directly compares the predicted RNA velocity of each gene with the
ground-truth RNA velocity (called the ``velocity correlation''), and one
which compares the direction of the ground-truth trajectory embedded in
a dimensionality reduction with the average RNA velocity of cells in
that neighbourhood (called the ``velocity arrow cosine''). While both
velocyto and scvelo obtained high scores for the velocity arrow cosine
metric (overall 25th percentile = 0.606), the velocity correlation is
rather low (overall 75th percentile = 0.156). This means that predicting
the RNA velocity (i.e.~transcription rate minus the decay rate) for
particular individual genes can be challenging, but the combined
information is very informative in determining the directionality of
cell progression in the trajectory. In terms of velocity correlation, no
method performed significantly better than the other, whereas ``scvelo
stochastic'' performed slightly worse than ``scvelo dynamical'' and
velocyto in terms of velocity arrow cosine score. Note that, given that
some genes are more informative in determining the overall
directionality of cell progression, performing a feature selection
before computing the embedded dimensionality reduction might result in
significantly improved velocity arrow cosine scores.

Use-case ``Cell-specific network inference'' (CSNI). CSNI methods
predict not only which transcription factors regulate which target
genes, but also aim to identify how active each interaction is in each
of the cells, since interactions can be turned off and on depending on
the cellular state. While a few pioneering CSNI approaches have already
been developed
\autocite{aibar_scenicsinglecellregulatory_2017,kuijjer_estimatingsamplespecificregulatory_2019,liu_personalizedcharacterizationdiseases_2016},
a quantitative assessment of their performance is until now lacking.
This is not surprising, as neither real nor in silico datasets of
cell-specific or even cell-type-specific interactions exist that are
large enough so that it can be used as a ground-truth for evaluating
CSNI methods. Extracting the ground-truth dynamic network in dyngen is
straightforward though, given that we can calculate how target gene
expression would change without the regulator being present. We used
this ground-truth to compare the performance of three CSNI methods
(Supplementary Fig.~3): LIONESS
\autocite{kuijjer_estimatingsamplespecificregulatory_2019}, SSN
\autocite{liu_personalizedcharacterizationdiseases_2016} and SCENIC
\autocite{aibar_scenicsinglecellregulatory_2017}. For each dataset, we
computed the mean AUROC and AUPR scores of the individual cells.
Comparing the mean AUROC and AUPR showed that pySCENIC significantly
outperforms both LIONESS and SSN, and in turn that LIONESS significantly
outperforms SSN. The poor performance of SSN is expected, as its
methodology for predicting a cell-specific is simply computing the
difference in Pearson correlation values applied to the whole dataset
and the whole dataset minus one sample. This strategy performs poorly in
large datasets where cell correlations are high, as the removal of one
cell will not yield large differences in correlation values and will
result in mostly noise. Overall, pySCENIC almost always performs better
than LIONESS, except for a few datasets where LIONESS does manage to
obtain a higher AUROC score. However, by using a different internal
network inference (e.g.~GENIE3
\autocite{huynh-thu_inferringregulatorynetworks_2010} or pySCENIC's
GRNBoost2 \autocite{moerman_grnboost2arboretoefficient_2019}) could
significantly increase the performance obtained by LIONESS.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

dyngen's single-cell simulations can be used to evaluate common
single-cell omics computational methods such as clustering, batch
correction, trajectory inference, and network inference. However, the
framework is flexible enough to be adaptable to a broad range of
applications, including methods that integrate clustering, network
inference, and trajectory inference. In this respect, dyngen may promote
the development of new tools in the single-cell field similarly as other
simulators have done in the past
\autocite{schaffter_genenetweaversilicobenchmark_2011,ewing_combiningtumorgenome_2015}.
Additionally, one could anticipate technological developments in
single-cell multi-omics. In this way, dyngen allows designing and
evaluating the performance and robustness of new types of computational
analyses before experimental data becomes available, comparing which
experimental protocol is the most cost-effective in producing
qualitative and robust results in downstream analysis. One major
assumption of dyngen is that cells are assumed to be well-mixed and
independent from each other. Subdividing a cell into multiple 2D or 3D
subvolumes or allowing cells to exchange molecules, respectively, could
pave the way to better study key cellular processes such as cell
division, intercellular communication, and migration
\autocite{smith_spatialstochasticintracellular_2019}.

\hypertarget{sec:dyngen-methods}{%
\section{Methods}\label{sec:dyngen-methods}}

The workflow to generate \emph{in silico} single-cell data consists of
six main steps (Supplementary Fig~4).

\hypertarget{sec:dyngen-modules}{%
\subsection{Defining the module network}\label{sec:dyngen-modules}}

One of the main processes involved in cellular dynamic processes is gene
regulation, where regulatory cascades and feedback loops lead to
progressive changes in expression and decision making. The exact way a
cell chooses a certain path during its differentiation is still an
active research field, although certain models have already emerged and
been tested \emph{in vivo}. One driver of bifurcation is mutual
antagonism, where two genes strongly repress each other
\autocite{rekhtman_directinteractionhematopoietic_1999,xu_regulationbifurcatingcell_2015},
forcing one of the two to become inactive
\autocite{graf_forcingcellschange_2009}. Such mutual antagonism can be
modelled and simulated
\autocite{wang_quantifyingwaddingtonlandscape_2011,ferrell_bistabilitybifurcationswaddington_2012}.
Although the two-gene model is simple and elegant, the reality is
frequently more complex, with multiple genes (grouped into modules)
repressing each other \autocite{yosef_dynamicregulatorynetwork_2013}.

To start a dyngen simulation, the user needs to define a module network.
The module network describes how sets of genes regulate each other and
is what mainly determines which dynamic processes occur within the
simulated cells.

A module network consists of modules connected together by regulatory
interactions, which can be either up- or down-regulating. A module may
have basal expression, which means genes in this module will be
transcribed without the presence of transcription factor molecules. A
module marked as ``active during the burn phase'' means that this module
will be allowed to generate expression of its genes during an initial
warm-up phase (See section \ref{sec:dyngen-simcell}). At the end of the
dyngen process, cells will not be sampled from the burn phase
simulations. Interactions between modules have a strength (which is a
positive integer) and an effect (+1 for upregulating, -1 for
downregulating).

Several examples of module networks are given in Supplementary Fig.~5. A
simple chain of modules (where one module upregulates the next) results
in a \emph{linear} process. By having the last module repress the first
module, the process becomes \emph{cyclic}. Two modules repressing each
other is the basis of a \emph{bifurcating} process, though several
chains of modules have to be attached in order to achieve progression
before and after the bifurcation process. Finally, a \emph{converging}
process has a bifurcation occurring during the burn phase, after which
any differences in module regulation is removed.

Note that these examples represent the bare minimum in terms of the
number of modules used. Using longer chains of modules is typically
desired. In addition, the fate decisions made in this example of a
bifurcation is reversible, meaning cells can be reprogrammed to go down
a different differentiation path. If this effect is undesirable, more
safeguards need to be put in place to prevent reprogramming from
occurring.

\hypertarget{sec:dyngen-grn}{%
\subsection{Generating the gene regulatory
network}\label{sec:dyngen-grn}}

The GRN is generated based on the given module network in four main
steps (Supplementary Fig.~6).

Step 1, sampling the transcription factors (TF). The TFs are the main
drivers of the molecular changes in the simulation. The user provides a
backbone and the number of TFs to generate. Each TF is assigned to a
module such that each module has at least \(x\) parameters (default
\(x=1\)). A TF inherits the `burn' and `basal expression' from the
module it belongs to.

Step 2, generating the TF interactions. Let each TF be regulated
according to the interactions in the backbone. These interactions
inherit the effect, strength, and independence parameters from the
interactions in the backbone. A TF can only be regulated by other TFs or
itself.

Step 3, sampling the target subnetwork. A user-defined number of target
genes are added to the GRN. Target genes are regulated by a TF or
another target gene, but are always downstream of at least one TF. To
sample the interactions between target genes, one of the many FANTOM5
\autocite{lizio_gatewaysfantom5promoter_2015} GRNs is sampled. The
currently existing TFs are mapped to regulators in the FANTOM5 GRN. The
targets are drawn from the FANTOM5 GRN weighted by their page rank
value, to create an induced GRN. For each target, at most \(x\)
regulators are sampled from the induced FANTOM5 GRN (default \(x=5\)).
The interactions connecting a target gene and its regulators are added
to the GRN.

Step 4, sampling the housekeeping subnetwork. Housekeeping genes are
completely separate from any TFs or target genes. A user-defined set of
housekeeping genes is also sampled from the FANTOM5 GRN. The
interactions of the FANTOM5 GRN are first subsampled such that the
maximum in-degree of each gene is \(x\) (default \(x=5\)). A random gene
is sampled and a breadth-first-search is performed to sample the desired
number of housekeeping genes.

Simulating a cell's GRN makes use of a stochastic framework which tracks
the abundance levels of molecules over time in a discrete quantity. For
every gene \(G\), the abundance levels of three molecules are tracked,
namely of corresponding pre-mRNAs, mature mRNAs and proteins, which are
represented by the terms \(\text{x}_{G}\), \(\text{y}_{G}\) and
\(\text{z}_{G}\) respectively. The GRN defines how a reaction affects
the abundance levels of molecules and how likely it will occur. Gibson
and Bruck \autocite{gibson_probabilisticmodelprokaryotic_2000} provide a
good introduction to modelling gene regulation with stochastic
frameworks, on which many of the concepts below are based.

For every gene in the GRN a set of reactions are defined, namely
transcription, splicing, translation, and degradation. Each reaction
consists of a propensity function -- a formula \(f(.)\) to calculate the
probability \(f(.) \times \text{d}t\) of it occurring during a time
interval \(\text{d}t\) -- and the effect -- how it will affect the
current state if triggered.

The effects of each reaction mimic the respective biological processes
(Supplementary Table~2, middle). Transcription of gene \(G\) results in
the creation of a single pre-mRNA molecule \(\text{x}_{G}\). Splicing
turns one pre-mRNA \(\text{x}_{G}\) into a mature mRNA \(\text{x}_{G}\).
Translation uses a mature mRNA \(\text{y}_{G}\) to produce a protein
\(\text{z}_{G}\). Pre-mRNA, mRNA and protein degradation results in the
removal of a \(\text{x}_{G}\), \(\text{y}_{G}\), and \(\text{z}_{G}\)
molecule, respectively.

The propensity of all reactions except transcription are all linear
functions (Supplementary Table~2, right) of the abundance level of some
molecule multiplied by a per-gene constant (Supplementary Table~3). The
propensity of transcription of a gene \(G\) depends on the abundance
levels of its TFs. The per-gene and per-interaction constants are based
on the median reported production-rates and half-lives of molecules
measured of 5000 mammalian genes
\autocite{schwanhausser_globalquantificationmammalian_2011}, except that
the transcription rate has been amplified by a factor of 10.

The propensity of the transcription of a gene \(G\) is inspired by
thermodynamic models of gene regulation
\autocite{schilstra_biologicgeneexpression_2008}, in which the promoter
of \(G\) can be bound or unbound by a set of \(N\) transcription factors
\(H_i\). Let \(f(\text{z}_{1}, \text{z}_{2}, \ldots, \text{z}_{N})\)
denote the propensity function of \(G\), in function of the abundance
levels of the transcription factors. The following subsections explain
and define the propensity function when \(N=1\), \(N=2\), and finally
for an arbitrary \(N\).

\hypertarget{propensity-of-transcription-when-n1}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Propensity of transcription when
\(N=1\)}{Propensity of transcription when N=1}}\label{propensity-of-transcription-when-n1}}

In the simplest case when \(N=1\), the promoter can be in one of two
states. In state \(S_0\), the promoter is not bound by any transcription
factors, and in state \(S_1\) the promoter is bound by \(H_1\). Each
state \(S_j\) is linked with a relative activation \(\alpha_j\), a
number between 0 and 1 representing the activity of the promoter at this
particular state. The propensity function is thus equal to the expected
value of the activity of the promoter multiplied by the pre-mRNA
production rate of \(G\).

\begin{align}
  f(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_N) & = \text{xpr} \cdot \sum_{j = 0}^{2^N - 1} \alpha_j \cdot P(S_j) \label{eqn:activ0} 
\end{align}

For \(N=1\), \(P(S_1)\) is equal to the Hill equation, where \(k_i\)
represents the concentration of \(H_i\) at half-occupation and \(n_i\)
represents the Hill coefficient. Typically, \(n_i\) is between
{[}1,10{]}

\begin{align}
  P(S_1) & = \frac{y_1^{n_1}}{k_1^{n_1} + y_1^{n_1}} \\
             & = \frac{(y_1/k_1)^{n_1}}{1 + (y_1/k_1)^{n_1}}
\end{align}

The Hill equation can be simplified by letting
\(\nu_i = \left(\frac{y_i}{k_i}\right)^{n_i}\).

\begin{align}
P(S_1) & = \frac{\nu_1}{1 + \nu_1} \label{eqn:hillsimp}
\end{align}

Since \(P(S_0) = 1 - P(S_1)\), the activation function is formulated and
simplified as follows.

\begin{align}
f(y_1) & = \text{xpr} \cdot \left(\alpha_0 \cdot P(S_0) + \alpha_1 \cdot P(S_1)\right) \\
           & = \text{xpr} \cdot \left(\alpha_0 \cdot \frac{1}{1 + \nu_1} + \alpha_1 \cdot \frac{\nu_1}{1 + \nu_1}\right) \\
           & = \text{xpr} \cdot \frac{\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \cdot \nu_1}{1 + \nu_1} \\
\end{align}

\hypertarget{propensity-of-transcription-when-n2}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Propensity of transcription when
\(N=2\)}{Propensity of transcription when N=2}}\label{propensity-of-transcription-when-n2}}

When \(N=2\), there are four states \(S_j\). The relative activations
\(\alpha_j\) can be defined such that \(H_1\) and \(H_2\) are
independent (additive) or synergistic (multiplicative). In order to
define the propensity of transcription \(f(.)\), the Hill equation
\(P(S_j)\) is extended for two transcription factors.

Let \(w_j\) be the numerator of \(P(S_j)\), defined as the product of
all transcription factors bound in that state:

\begin{align}
w_0 & = 1 \\
w_1 & = \nu_1 \\
w_2 & = \nu_2 \\
w_3 & = \nu_1 \cdot \nu_2
\end{align}

The denominator of \(P(S_j)\) is then equal to the sum of all \(w_j\).
The probability of state \(S_j\) is thus defined as:

\begin{align}
    P(S_j) & = \frac{w_j}{\sum_{j=0}^{j < 2^N} w_j} \\
               & = \frac{w_j}{1 + \nu_1 + \nu_2 + \nu_1 \cdot \nu_2} \\
               & = \frac{w_j}{\prod_{i=1}^{i \leq N} (\nu_i + 1)}
\end{align}

Substituting \(P(S_j)\) and \(w_j\) into \(f(.)\) results in the
following equation:

\begin{align}
f(y_1, y_2) & = \text{xpr} \cdot \sum_{j = 0}^{2^N - 1} \alpha_j \cdot P(S_j) \\
 & = \text{xpr} \cdot \frac{\sum_{j = 0}^{2^N - 1} \alpha_j \cdot w_j}{\prod_{i=1}^{i \leq N} (\nu_i + 1)} \\
 & = \text{xpr} \cdot \frac{\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 \cdot \nu_1 + \alpha_2 \cdot \nu_2 + \alpha_3 \cdot \nu_1 \cdot \nu_2}{(\nu_1 + 1) \cdot (\nu_2 + 1)} \\
\end{align}

\hypertarget{propensity-of-transcription-for-an-arbitrary-n}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Propensity of transcription for an
arbitrary
\(N\)}{Propensity of transcription for an arbitrary N}}\label{propensity-of-transcription-for-an-arbitrary-n}}

For an arbitrary \(N\), there are \(2^N\) states \(S_j\). The relative
activations \(\alpha_j\) can be defined such that \(H_1\) and \(H_2\)
are independent (additive) or synergistic (multiplicative). In order to
define the propensity of transcription \(f(.)\), the Hill equation
\(P(S_j)\) is extended for \(N\) transcription factors.

Let \(w_j\) be the numerator of \(P(S_j)\), defined as the product of
all transcription factors bound in that state:

\begin{align}
  w_j & = \prod_{i=1}^{i \leq N} (j \text{ mod } i) = 1 \text{ ? } \nu_i \text{ : } 1
\end{align}

The denominator of \(P(S_j)\) is then equal to the sum of all \(w_j\).
The probability of state \(S_j\) is thus defined as:

\begin{align}
P(S_j) & = \frac{w_j}{\sum_{j=0}^{j < 2^N} w_j} \\
& = \frac{w_j}{\prod_{i=1}^{i \leq N} (\nu_i + 1)}
\end{align}

Substituting \(P(S_j)\) into \(f(.)\) yields:

\begin{align}
f(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_N) & = \text{xpr} \cdot \sum_{j = 0}^{2^N - 1} \alpha_j \cdot P(S_j) \\
& = \text{xpr} \cdot \frac{\sum_{j = 0}^{2^N - 1} \alpha_j \cdot w_j}{\prod_{i=1}^{i \leq N} (\nu_i + 1)} \label{eqn:prop2n}
\end{align}

\hypertarget{propensity-of-transcription-for-a-large-n}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Propensity of transcription for a large
\(N\)}{Propensity of transcription for a large N}}\label{propensity-of-transcription-for-a-large-n}}

For large values of \(N\), computing \(f(.)\) is practically infeasible
as it requires performing \(2^N\) summations. In order to greatly
simplify \(f(.)\), \(\alpha_j\) could be defined as 0 when one of the
regulators inhibits transcription and 1 otherwise.

\begin{equation}
\alpha_j = \begin{cases}
 0 & \text{ if } \exists i : j \text{ mod } i = 1 \text{ and } H_i \text{ represses } G \\
 1 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \label{eqn:assalpha}
\end{equation}

Substituting equation \ref{eqn:assalpha} into equation \ref{eqn:prop2n}
and defining \(R = \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}\) and
\(R^+ = \{i | H_i \text{ activates } G\}\) yields the simplified
propensity function:

\begin{align}
f(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_N) & = \text{xpr} \cdot \frac{\prod_{i \in R^+} (\nu_i + 1)}{\prod_{i \in R} (\nu_i + 1)}
\end{align}

\hypertarget{independence-synergism-and-basal-expression}{%
\subsubsection{Independence, synergism and basal
expression}\label{independence-synergism-and-basal-expression}}

The definition of \(\alpha_j\) as in equation \ref{eqn:assalpha}
presents two main limitations. Firstly, since \(\alpha_0 = 1\), it is
impossible to tweak the propensity of transcription when no
transcription factors are bound. Secondly, it is not possible to tweak
the independence and synergism of multiple regulators.

Let \(\text{ba} \in [0,1]\) denote the basal expression strength \(G\)
(i.e.~how much will \(G\) be expressed when no transcription factors are
bound), and \(\text{sy} \in [0,1]\) denote the synergism of regulators
\(H_i\) of \(G\), the transcription propensity becomes:

\begin{align}
f(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_N) & = \text{xpr} \cdot \frac{\text{ba} - \text{sy}^{|R^+|} + \prod_{i \in R^+} (\nu_i + \text{sy})}{\prod_{i \in R} (\nu_i + 1)}
\end{align}

\hypertarget{sec:dyngen-simcell}{%
\subsection{Simulate single cells}\label{sec:dyngen-simcell}}

dyngen uses Gillespie's stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA)
\autocite{gillespie_exactstochasticsimulation_1977} to simulate dynamic
processes. An SSA simulation is an iterative process where at each
iteration one reaction is triggered.

Each reaction consists of its propensity -- a formula to calculate the
probability of the reaction occurring during an infinitesimal time
interval -- and the effect -- how it will affect the current state if
triggered. Each time a reaction is triggered, the simulation time is
incremented by
\(\tau = \frac{1}{\sum_j \textrm{prop}_j} \ln\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)\),
with \(r \in U(0, 1)\) and \(\textrm{prop}_j\) the propensity value of
the \(j\)th reaction for the current state of the simulation.

GillespieSSA2 is an optimised library for performing SSA simulations.
The propensity functions are compiled to C++ and SSA approximations can
be used which allow triggering many reactions simultaneously at each
iteration. The framework also allows storing the abundance levels of
molecules only after a specific interval has passed since the previous
census. By setting the census interval to 0, the whole simulation's
trajectory is retained but many of these time points will contain very
similar information. In addition to the abundance levels, also the
propensity values and the number of firings of each of the reactions at
each of the time steps can be retained.

\hypertarget{sec:dyngen-experiment}{%
\subsection{Simulate experiment}\label{sec:dyngen-experiment}}

From the SSA simulation we obtain the abundance levels of all the
molecules at every state. We need to replicate technical effects
introduced by experimental protocols in order to obtain data that is
similar to real data. For this, the cells are sampled from the
simulations and molecules are sampled for each of the cells. Gene
capture rates and library sizes are empirically derived from real
datasets as to match real technical variation.

\hypertarget{sample-cells}{%
\subsubsection{Sample cells}\label{sample-cells}}

In this step, \(N\) cells are sampled from the simulations. Two
approaches are implemented: sampling from an unsynchronised population
of single cells (snapshot) or sampling at multiple time points in a
synchronised population (time series).

\textbf{Snapshot} The backbone consists of several states linked
together by transition edges with length \(L_i\), to which the different
states in the different simulations have been mapped (Supplementary
Fig.~7A). From each transition, \(N_i = N / \frac{L_i}{\sum L_i}\) cells
are sampled uniformly, rounded such that \(\sum N_i = N\).

\textbf{Time series} Assuming that the final time of the simulation is
\(T\), the interval \([0, T]\) is divided into \(k\) equal intervals of
width \(w\) separated by \(k-1\) gaps of width \(g\). \(N_i = N / k\)
cells are sampled uniformly from each interval (Supplementary Fig.~7B),
rounded such that \(\sum N_i = N\). By default, \(k = 8\) and
\(g = 0.75\). For usual dyngen simulations, \(10 \leq T \leq 20\). For
larger values of \(T\), \(k\) and \(g\) should be increased accordingly.

\hypertarget{sample-molecules}{%
\subsubsection{Sample molecules}\label{sample-molecules}}

Molecules are sampled from the simulation to replicate how molecules are
experimentally sampled. A real dataset is downloaded from a repository
of single-cell RNA-seq datasets
\autocite{cannoodt_singlecellomicsdatasets_2018}. For each \emph{in
silico} cell \(i\), draw its library size \(ls_i\) from the distribution
of transcript counts per cell in the real dataset. The capture rate
\(cr_j\) of each \emph{in silico} molecule type \(j\) is drawn from
\(N(1, 0.05)\). Finally, for each cell \(i\), draw \(ls_i\) molecules
from the multinomial distribution with probabilities
\(cr_j \times ab_{i,j}\) with \(ab_{i,j}\) the molecule abundance level
of molecule \(j\) in cell \(i\).

\hypertarget{sec:dyngen-batcheffect}{%
\subsection{Simulating batch effects}\label{sec:dyngen-batcheffect}}

Simulating batch effects can be performed in multiple ways. One such way
is to perform the first two steps of the creation of a dyngen model
(defining the module network and generating the GRN). For each desired
batch, create a separate model for which random kinetics are generated
and perform all subsequent dyngen steps (convert to reactions, simulate
gold standard, simulate single cells, simulate experiment). Since each
separate model has different underlying kinetics, the combined output
will resemble having batch effects.

\hypertarget{sec:dyngen-groundtruth}{%
\subsection{Determining the ground-truth
trajectory}\label{sec:dyngen-groundtruth}}

To construct the ground-truth trajectory, the user needs to provide the
ground-truth state network alongside the initial module network
(Supplementary Fig.~8). Each edge in the state network specifies which
modules are allowed to change in expression in transitioning from one
state to another. For each edge, a simulation is run using the end state
of an upstream branch as the initial expression vector, and only
allowing the modules as predefined by the attribute to change.

As an example, consider the cyclic trajectory shown in Supplementary
Fig.~8. State S0 begins with an expression vector of all zero values. To
simulate the transition from S0 to S1, regulation of the genes in
modules A, B and C are turned on. After a predefined period of time, the
end state of this transition is considered the expression vector of
state S1. To simulate the transition from S1 to S2, regulation of the
genes in modules D and E are turned on, while the regulation of genes in
module C is turned off. During this simulation, the expression of genes
in modules A, B, D, and E is thus allowed to change. The end state of
the simulation is considered the expression vector of state S2.

For each of the branches in the state network, an expression matrix and
the corresponding progression time along that branch are retained. To
map a simulated cell to the ground-truth, the correlation between its
expression values and the expression matrix of the ground-truth
trajectory is calculated, and the cell is mapped to the position in the
ground-truth trajectory that has the highest correlation.

\hypertarget{sec:dyngen-extractgrn}{%
\subsection{Determining the cell-specific ground-truth regulatory
network}\label{sec:dyngen-extractgrn}}

Calculating the regulatory effect of a regulator \(R\) on a target \(T\)
(Supplementary Fig.~4F) requires determining the contribution of \(R\)
in the propensity function of the transcription of \(T\)
(section~\ref{sec:dyngen-reactions}) with respect to other regulators.
This information is useful, amongst others, for benchmarking
cell-specific network inference methods.

The regulatory effect of \(R\) on \(T\) at a particular state \(S\) is
defined as the change in the propensity of transcription when \(R\) is
set to zero, scaled by the inverse of the pre-mRNA production rate of
\(T\). More formally:

\begin{eqnarray*}
  \text{regeffect}_G & = \frac{\text{proptrans}_G(S) - \text{proptrans}_G(S[\text{z}_{T} \leftarrow 0])}{\text{xpr}_{G}}
\end{eqnarray*}

Determining the regulatory effect for all interactions and cells in the
dataset yields the complete cell-specific ground-truth GRN. The
regulatory effect lies between \([-1, 1]\), where -1 represents complete
inhibition of \(T\) by \(R\), 1 represents maximal activation of \(T\)
by \(R\), and 0 represents inactivity of the regulatory interaction
between \(R\) and \(T\).

\hypertarget{sec:dyngen-nicompare}{%
\subsection{Comparison of cell-specific network inference
methods}\label{sec:dyngen-nicompare}}

42 datasets were generated using the 14 different predefined backbones
and three different seeds. For every cell in the dataset, the
transcriptomics profile and the corresponding cell-specific ground-truth
regulatory network was determined (Section~\ref{sec:dyngen-extractgrn}).

We selected three cell-specific NI methods: SCENIC
\autocite{aibar_scenicsinglecellregulatory_2017}, LIONESS
\autocite{kuijjer_estimatingsamplespecificregulatory_2015,kuijjer_estimatingsamplespecificregulatory_2019},
and SSN \autocite{liu_personalizedcharacterizationdiseases_2016}.

LIONESS \autocite{kuijjer_estimatingsamplespecificregulatory_2019} runs
a NI method multiple times to construct cell-specific GRNs. LIONESS
first infers a GRN with all of the samples. A second GRN is inferred
with all samples except one particular profile. The cell-specific GRN
for that particular profile is defined as the difference between the two
GRN matrices. This process is repeated for all profiles, resulting in a
cell-specific GRN. By default, LIONESS uses PANDA
\autocite{glass_passingmessagesbiological_2013} to infer GRNs, but since
dyngen does not produce motif data and motif data is required by PANDA,
PANDA is inapplicable in this context. Instead, we used the lionessR
\autocite{kuijjer_lionessrsinglesample_2019} implementation of LIONESS,
which uses by default the Pearson correlation as a NI method. We marked
results from this implementation as ``LIONESS + Pearson''.

SSN \autocite{liu_personalizedcharacterizationdiseases_2016} follows, in
essence, the exact same methodology as LIONESS except that it
specifically only uses the Pearson correlation. It is worth noting that
the LIONESS preprint was released before the publication of SSN. Since
no implementation was provided by the authors, we implemented SSN in R
using basic R and tidyverse functions
\autocite{wickham_welcometidyverse_2019} and marked results from this
implementation as "SSN*".

SCENIC \autocite{aibar_scenicsinglecellregulatory_2017} consists of four
main steps. First, classical network inference is performed with
stochastic gradient boosting machines using \texttt{arboreto}
\autocite{moerman_grnboost2arboretoefficient_2019}. Second, the top 10
regulators of every target gene are selected. Interactions are grouped
together in `modules'; each module contains one regulator and all of its
targets. Next, the modules are filtered using motif analysis. Finally,
for each module and each cell, an activity score is calculated using
AUCell. As a post-processing of this output, all modules and the
corresponding activity scores are combined back into a cell-specific GRN
consisting of (cell, regulator, target, score) pairs. For this analysis,
the Python implementation of SCENIC was used, namely pySCENIC
\autocite{vandesande_scalablescenicworkflow_2020}. Since dyngen does not
generate motif data, step 3 in this analysis is skipped.

The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic-curve (AUROC) and
Area Under the Precision-Recall curve (AUPR) metrics are common metrics
for evaluating a predicted GRN with a ground-truth GRN
\autocite{marbach_generatingrealisticsilico_2009}. To compare a
predicted cell-specific GRN with the ground-truth cell-specific GRN, the
top 10'000 interactions per cell is retained, and the mean AUROC and
AUPR scores are calculated across all cells.

We compared the mean AUROC and AUPR scores obtained by the three CSNI
methods across all datasets by performing pairwise non-parametric paired
two-sided Durbin-Conover tests
\autocite{conover_multiplecomparisonsprocedures_1979} using
\texttt{pairwiseComparisons}
\autocite{patil_pairwisecomparisonsmultiplepairwise_2019}. Test
statistics and p-values for the all pairwise combinations are reported
in the Source Data file. Reported p-values are adjusted for multiple
testing using Holm correction
\autocite{holm_simplesequentiallyrejective_1979}.

\hypertarget{sec:dyngen-velcompare}{%
\subsection{Comparison of RNA velocity
methods}\label{sec:dyngen-velcompare}}

Three datasets were generated for each of the 14 different predefined
backbones, resulting in a collection of 42 datasets. Throughout each of
the simulation, the propensity of the transcription and mRNA decay is
collected, as the RNA velocity of a gene at any point in the simulation
is the difference between the transcription propensity and the mRNA
decay propensity.

We applied two RNA velocity methods: velocyto
\autocite{lamanno_rnavelocitysingle_2018}, as implemented in the
\texttt{velocyto.py} package, and scvelo method
\autocite{bergen_generalizingrnavelocity_2020}, as implemented in the
\texttt{scvelo} package. For scvelo, we chose two parameter settings for
``mode'', namely ``stochastic'' and ``dynamical''. For both methods, we
used the same normalized data as provided by dyngen, with no extra cell
or feature filtering, but otherwise matched the parameters to their
respective tutorial vignettes as well as possible.

We compared each RNA velocity prediction to the ground-truth using two
metrics: the velocity correlation and the velocity arrow cosine. For the
velocity correlation, we extracted a ground truth RNA velocity by
subtracting for each mRNA molecule the propensity of its production by
the propensity of its degradation. If the expression of an mRNA will
increase in the future, this value is positive, while it is negative if
it is going to decrease. For each gene, we determined its velocity
correlation by calculating the Spearman rank correlation between the
ground truth velocity with the observed velocity. For the velocity arrow
cosine, we determined a set of 100 trajectory waypoints uniformly spread
on the trajectory. For each waypoint, we weighted each cell based on a
Gaussian kernel on its geodesic distance from the waypoint. These
weights were used to calculate a weighted average velocity vector of
each waypoint. We then calculated for each waypoint the cosine
similarity between this velocity vector and the known direction of the
trajectory.

We compared the velocity correlation and velocity arrow cosine scores
obtained by velocyto and scvelo across all datasets by performing
pairwise non-parametric paired two-sided Durbin-Conover tests
\autocite{conover_multiplecomparisonsprocedures_1979} using
\texttt{pairwiseComparisons}
\autocite{patil_pairwisecomparisonsmultiplepairwise_2019}. Test
statistics and p-values for the all pairwise combinations are reported
in the Source Data file. Reported p-values are adjusted for multiple
testing using Holm correction
\autocite{holm_simplesequentiallyrejective_1979}.

\hypertarget{sec:dyngen-tacompare}{%
\subsection{Comparison of trajectory
alignment}\label{sec:dyngen-tacompare}}

Four custom linear backbones of varying sizes were constructed. For each
of these backbones, 10 datasets were generated with 10 different seeds,
resulting in a total of 40 datasets. Every dataset is generated in three
main steps. First, the GRN is generated based on the given backbone.
Next, generating the kinetics, gold standard, and cells is performed
twice, resulting in two sub-datasets. Finally, the two sub-datasets are
combined and cells are sampled from the combined dataset. Since the two
sub-datasets were simulated with different kinetic parameters, the
combined dataset will contain two trajectories.

On each combined dataset we applied two trajectory alignment methods,
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
\autocite{giorgino_computingvisualizingdynamic_2009} and cellAlign
\autocite{alpert_alignmentsinglecelltrajectories_2018}. DTW is designed
to align temporal sequences by dilating or contracting the sequences to
best match each other. cellAlign uses DTW to perform this alignment, but
first interpolates and rescales the input data in order to better cope
with single-cell omics data.

To evaluate a trajectory alignment method on a combined dataset we
computed the geodesic distances of each cell from the start of the
trajectory, also called the \emph{pseudotime}. For each dataset, the
pseudotime values are rescaled between 0 and 1 to allow for easier
comparison. A trajectory alignment produces a sequence of index pairs
\([(i_0, j_0), (i_1, j_1), \ldots, (i_N, j_N)]\), where \(i_0\) and
\(j_0\) are equal to 0 (the first position in both pseudotime series),
\(i_N\) and \(j_N\) are equal to the respective last positions in the
pair of pseudotime series, and \([i_0, i_1, \ldots, i_N]\) and
\([j_0, j_1, \ldots, j_N]\) are in ascending order and can contain
duplicates values. The ABWAP metric is defined as follows, where
\(pt_1\) and \(pt_2\) are the unit pseudotime vectors. See Supplementary
Fig.~1D for a visual interpretation of this metric.

\begin{equation}
  \textrm{ABWAP} = 1 - \textrm{area\_under\_curve}(pt_1[i_0 .. i_N] + pt_2[j_0 .. j_N], abs(pt_1[i_0 .. i_N] - pt_2[j_0 .. j_N]))
\end{equation}

We compared the ABWAP scores obtained by DTW and cellAlign across all
datasets by performing pairwise non-parametric paired two-sided
Durbin-Conover tests
\autocite{conover_multiplecomparisonsprocedures_1979} using
\texttt{pairwiseComparisons}
\autocite{patil_pairwisecomparisonsmultiplepairwise_2019}. Test
statistics and p-values for the all pairwise combinations are reported
in the Source Data file. Reported p-values are adjusted for multiple
testing using Holm correction
\autocite{holm_simplesequentiallyrejective_1979}.
